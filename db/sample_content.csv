"the ultimate match up between good and evil 
"based on the 1959 television show of the same title 
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .
"however 
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .
"the film begins with capone 
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .
"from this point we know capone is evil 
"right from the first five minutes of the film 
"this developed hatred is before the film's hero 
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .
the film only gets better from this point .
"with the formation of the untouchables 
they walk in unison and they only look forward .
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .

"however 
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .
"sean connery 
malone acts as a mentor to ness .
"he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife 
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .
"andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone 
"as ness grows 
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .
"also very similar to "" the matrix 
">from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps 
the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .
its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .
the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .
"although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified 
"some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat

world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .
"scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence 
"after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) 
"scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies

""" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america ."
jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental .
in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers .
he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present .
"preceding the very original "" a soldier's story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane

tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him .
"as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains 
"poitier also gives an excellent 
"never nervous and always commanding 
"however 
"as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him 
he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople .
"he would refer to tibbs as "" boy "" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him ."
"as the film progresses though 
he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors .
what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film .
he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil .
"instead 
most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes .
this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day .
jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate .
""" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's ."
it displays this perfectly .
"however 
it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim .
there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) .
"also

summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant !
to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis .
he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town .
we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them .
quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee .
the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely .
"unlike many comedies this film tries 
the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story .
"the performances of all the principals are right on the mark 
"so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted 
"longer 
"the primary reason i enjoyed this film was 
too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh .
"you watch the movie 
matinee is not like that .
i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis .
i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film .
"but most importantly 
"the comedy of the film centers around goodman 
i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today .
he is highly expressive both physically and vocally .
i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink .
"the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature 
"the movie is really the story of the four teenagers 
i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic .
"they tried to block it out 
"unfortunately it kept creeping back in 
"while the comedy centered on goodman 
several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light .
one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store .
"if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy 
another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies .
one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space .
"( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies 
while mant !
"never got made 
serves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves .
"so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good 
"this isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent 
enjoy !

this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is .
"he is his son+s last nemesis 
"but he truly loves his son

"because of his character

synopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel .
"in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict 
"the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class "" gentleman . """
"pip leaves for london with "" great expectations "" to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella ."
but life has a way of complicating things .
pip becomes an arrogant s . o . b .
until he learns just who his secret benefactor is .
in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) .
"but soon the focus of finn's life becomes romance 
"estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) 
"this causes estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships 
"when finn becomes a young man 
"finn leaves florida with "" great expectations "" to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella ."
"what will happen to all of finn's "" great expectations ? """
"opinion : if you're looking for a romance with a happy ending 
ethan hawke is romantic lead .
( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites .
he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise .
he romanced uma thurman in gattaca .
"now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow 
"hawke plays a lovestruck 
meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate .
"anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor 
"the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love

"the two actors

yes .
does it matter ?
not really .
the film opens in october of 1969 .
"firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job 
"the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 
a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day .
"though both are initially skeptical of the idea 
"now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive 
"frank and john now must work together to set things right 
"the premise of "" frequency "" is unusual 
this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it .
"when frank doesn't die in a fire 
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other .
"sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world 
"now 
"when "" frequency "" gets cooking 
"what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment 
the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion .
"director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure "" frequency "" as good hollywood entertainment 
"i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens 
it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him .
"( admittedly 
"i even liked the final scene 
"some may find this scene blindingly confusing 
"there are enough surprises and plot twists in "" frequency "" to keep you on your toes 
"the other major thing to appreciate about "" frequency "" is the handling of the father-son relationship ."
quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors .
"the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative 
watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question .
"the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters 
"here 
i also liked some of the supporting cast members .
"elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles 
"andre braugher 
he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes .
"braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here 
"perhaps the only thing i didn't like about "" frequency "" is the overly sentimental coda 
but that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics .
"i freely acknowledge that "" frequency "" may best work as a "" guy "" movie

his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire .
including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust .
blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother .
"but this isn't as easy as it seems 
"the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires 
where do vampires get money ?

blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community .
"he isn't content to live among humans 
he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable .
it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire .
"admittedly 
"the story is a relatively forgettable one 
the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type .
"this isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances 
the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise .
"it's a popcorn movie 
blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster .
the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done .
"although 
blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre .
this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle .
what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life .

in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !
"i won't say how 
sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .
her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .
the rest of the cast is also quite good .
"notably 
alien 3 has a very distinct look .
"this is due largely to its director 
"mr . fincher 
"his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before ."
"for mr . fincher 
the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .
"elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in ."
this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .
this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .
this is a great score .
the ending to alien 3 is quite good .
"there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up 
i will not ruin the ending for you .
go see the film .
i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .
alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .
"and when they make alien 4 
are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ?
wafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves .
"everyweek 
reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video .
here is a sample review :
welcome to sarajevo
"in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo 
"set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events 
the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding .
"as they make their way down the street 
yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war .
"in this scene 
"joe is cocky 
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) .
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest .
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread .
he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth .
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines .
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult .
"during his visits 
he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance .
"after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children 
"however 
"unfortunately 
"the group of children 
can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ?
the movie was beautifully and sensitively made .
director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred .
"they show the destroyed lives 
"this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson 
the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities .
one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth .
"like the rest of those deeply effected by the war 
winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room .
the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics .
winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities .
this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com
selection mad city .
"we watch them struggle to cover the horror 
"however 
stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson .
he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events .
dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy .
"henderson realizes that he cannot save the world 
it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea .
"woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest 
harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through .
"harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers 
"this ability will serve him well and give him a long 
america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place .
"for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict 
war is a foreign concept to most of us in america .
battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to .
televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war .
"this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world 
many people dislike french films for their lack of closure .
"while possibly shallow 
"there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however 
stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker .
he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing .
"even the relationship between he and his boss 
"in the beginning of the movie 
camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes .
maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife .
"like stephane 
"when stephane and camille meet 
"however 
"stephane ignores his feelings for camille 
"as the movie progresses 
"these two people 
"stephane becomes even more rational and controlled 
"however 
"the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well 
"however 
"consequently 
"in contrast 
"however 
"during the course of the movie 
stephane attempts to remain unchanged .
"however 
one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash .
"the development of all of the characters 
"american movies 
"in its essence 
"the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie 
"i am not sure why berardinelli says 
"this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong 
"i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately 
"this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished ."
"unfortunately 
"while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart 
the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen .
the directing in this movie is wonderful .
"the actors and actresses are excellent 
emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful .
"and needless to say 
"besides the near ending 
i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of .
"the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot 
"i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at 
"in summary 
"in the process 
"in itself 
"where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we 
i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .
"however 
i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .
"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber 
"the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) 
he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .
"always the shrewd thinker 
this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .
"when he is prepared to execute his plan 
"now a seemingly twitching vegetable 
carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him .
she's a very bright person with a good heart .
"yet 
the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .
her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .
"worse 
they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom .
"to her 
"but now 
"wayne seems equally bored with his life 
wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .
"carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients 
"however 
the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke .
"carol 
"maybe she can get through to him 
the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . '
and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ?
perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses .
"if that fails 
"when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance 
carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .
she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .
"this 
henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .
henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash .
"meanwhile 
"wayne is uncomfortable with the situation 
"however 
"the heist sequence is suspenseful 
`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .
"newman is the real joy of the film 
"he possesses a sly smile 
fiorentino is also a fun presence .
you root for her despite her sense of amorality .
"sure 
"with two charismatic characters such as these 
"robert benton has assembled a stellar 
paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross .
"harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) 
"when jack sends him on a routine delivery job 
"soon 
"there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight 
"james garner plays raymond hope 
"stockard channing plays verna 
"reese witherspoon is mel 
"giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi 
"with a cast like that 
"luckily 
twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot .
"it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics 
"the major cast members all deliver strong performances 
"however 
"the supporting cast is enjoyable 
"stockard channing's character 
there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe .
"it's a minor 
"with a solid cast 
it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time .
"at a slim 94 minutes 
"still 
"warning : anyone offended by blatant 
"or lots of blood & guts 
"in other words 
with a john milius script !
i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches .
"these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with 
"and we got tough guys galore 
"in particular 
torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone .
as to women . . .
"well 
"women exist here to look good 
gosh !
just like the old days . . .
"frankly 
"the cinematography is excellent 
i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up .
"finally 
"accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner 
one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .
"rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery 
"in short 
yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .
"ralph fiennes is the title character 
"but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together 
his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld .
"the same can easily be said for every other character in the film 
juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart .
"at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her 
"even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion 
"with so many characters enjoying so little screen time 
yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air .
hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .
there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .
but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .
"in the end 
bore is perhaps too strong a word .
"but after drinking in the rich production values 
"a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates 
"it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old 
he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .
"his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire 
he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .
"he could have cut a deal and gotten off 
he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .
the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .
"on one of the heists 
"coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) 
"he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents 
"with the sentencing date closing in on him 
he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .
"thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire 
"but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer 
warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .
the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .
the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .
"coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says 
"dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style 
"this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets 
"the city streets are ugly 
"there is a fatalistic feel about their lives 
"mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs 
it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .
"mitchum is a loser ; and 
"but in the end 
""" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics ."
and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .
"the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city 
he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .
"as mentioned at the beginning of this review 
"there are virtually no surprises 
so why did i enjoy it so much ?
"for one thing 
kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .
"we're rooting for him right from the start 
"yes 
and he never broods .
the rest of the cast is equally impressive .
"john lithgow 
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .
"by the end of the film 
another nice touch is the music .
"we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" 
"the title track 
"during the final sequence 
"of course 
"anyway 
don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .
"it sucked me in 
"as i walked out of crouching tiger 
"with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa ."
attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs .
i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology .
"as the word implies 
as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality .

"the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop 
"it is the gifted pupil who 
the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented .
the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively .
"the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force 
there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry .
"as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line 
"do not assume

"hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife

"in fact 
the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story .
one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck .
"but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated

kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other .
most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife .
"ford does not have a lot of lines here 
"just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits 
"we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed 
meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down .
"at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues 
he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery .
one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor .
there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) .
"they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer 
the final act concludes with another terrific chase .
"richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him 
"the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along 
"maybe the finally scene is a bit much 
we're so relieved when justice is served .
"it's not the plot is that makes "" the fugitive "" great 
watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous .
if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .

i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .
"even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) 
but i don't care .
not even a little .
my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .
2 ) drew barrymore is great .
3 ) the movie is so funny .
there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .
i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .
"sandler plays robby hart 
"in the opening scenes 
"a week later 
"with his life in complete disarray 
"she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) 
julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .
"soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk 
"oh sure 
"and if anyone making this film expected us to 
"what makes the story bearable 
barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .
"not only is she pleasant to look at 
"and the jerk 
"naturally 
i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .
"he can say something that just isn't funny 
"his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore 
"whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler 
"as far as i'm concerned he succeeded 
and the movie is just so funny .
perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .
this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .
"and while the film 
my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important .
"the film is predicable 
"the characters are extremely likable 
"in addition to this 
"in that order 
i just want everyone to know that i laughed .
a lot .
"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name 
"recap a few thousand years later 
"problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress 
"walking in with relatively low expectations 
"the visuals and cgi are astounding 
"they pack a ton of detail into the images 
"the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes 
"unfortunately 
"on one hand 
"on the other 
"and on the side 
"ideally 
"the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief 
"if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy 
and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies .
"while really well done 
replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .
"while entertaining and funny 
but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .
"on the whole 
but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn
the sound down !
"while a lot of theatres have good sound systems 
"when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film 
"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae 
"in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles 
"while it's certainly not perfect 
"the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae "" ."
"with the police on his back for leads 
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .
"he brings grace 
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .
"argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral 
tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .
"needless to say for argento fans 
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .
"they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light 
"instead 
and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .
"so tenebrae has much to recommend it 
"still 
"some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films 
"by the way 
"about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which 
"we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who 
"he is insane 
the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .
"he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax ."
"but argento muffs the twist 
"you see 
"but thanks to poor editing 
bad cutting puts the timing way out .
"in other words 
during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .
by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .
the injury ?
he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !
"thus 
"helpfully 
"but there too is a problem 
"the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind 
tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .
"for instance 
"we would assume the rider is the same boy 
"that's careless filmmaking 
"why 
"because when it comes to visuals and set pieces 
take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .
an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .
"finally 
"it's an absolutely masterful sequence 
and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .
"too often 
"mind you 
and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential .
see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .
"it's a stylish 
"a shame 
"take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) 
"proof that he can do it 
"as any sociologist will attest 
parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .
"but if your upbringing is marred with violence 
`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .
the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .
here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .
he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .
"but as you scratch beneath the surface 
we see that he is a mean-tempered person .
"he has a hard time taking control of his emotions 
"he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person 
he also has tremendous problems with relationships .
he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .
but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .
he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .
his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .
"she tries to remain true to him and supportive 
"finally 
"as a rejected father 
"as the town's only police officer 
we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .
he is a prisoner and a slave to it .
he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .
what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?
we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .
this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .
he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .
we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .
"to heighten the father's churlishness 
very effective .
"today 
"the influence that the father possesses is inescapable 
the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .
"this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama 
he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .
coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .
"but 
there's nothing light or fluffy about this film .
that may turn many moviegoers away .
but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents .
is evil dead ii a bad movie ?
"it's full of terrible acting 
explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .
`well what's it about ? '
"`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly 
`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .
why should i see it again ? '
"`no evil dead ii is different 
`it's funny to see people die ?
are you sick or something ? '
maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .
"his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle 
an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .
"sure it's over-the-top 
"the whole movie is like this 
"the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets 
"no matter how sick it may sound 
"and raimi takes advantage 
"like the less superior idle hands 
"but it doesn't end 
"all of these events 
"raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses

">from the commercials 
instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .
the concept is deceptively pedestrian .
an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .
the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .
the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .
"following one dead end lead after another 
it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .
seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .
"without giving too much away 
"and it's all done in a fairly clean 
"a grand cast ( tomlin 
"drawing from a more hyper woody allen style 
i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review .
"i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire "" wag the dog 
"quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through 
"they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works 
"a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's "" dr ."
"strangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy 
"that said 
"the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president 
"the accusations 
"brean 
"as i said 
"another scene shows us how 
the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt .
"william "" old shoe "" schumann ( woody harrelson ) 
"of course 
"still 
"regardless of the official word from the president or the cia 
"the film never addresses this question 
schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it .
"there was also an instance 
"with these plot holes 
"brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather 
"the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end 
"motss and his hollywood buddies 
"in fact 
"i think it's fair to say that "" wag the dog "" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire ."
"still 
"wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks 
"with this premise and the talented cast 
the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible .
"people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized 
"five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days 
the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry .
"as the introduction explains 
"in 1944 
each of the five tells his or her story .
"their stories are intercut chronologically 
"they recall the nazi invasion of hungary 
"they recall their horrible 
"each recalls his or her unfathomable 
"and finally 
"needless to say 
"by themselves 
"the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories 
"in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen 
the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days .
it's not clear which scene it is .
"it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before 
"one is rare color footage 
"there is something jarring 
another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore .
there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say .
"but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war 
and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject .
the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful .
"x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary 
"also 
so the richness and detail are impeccable .
the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen .
"there is a theatrical trailer for the movie 
"there are about fifty still photos 
"also 
one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) .
"you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary 
"instead 
one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film .
"renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch 
"firestone was aggressive 
the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable .
another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz .
"he ends his prayer by saying "" . . . forgive me for surviving . """
it's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film .
"it's ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable 
it's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers .
but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well .
"it's only fitting that the dvd 
it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death .
"after having said that 
"one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake 
"there is no ocean 
in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) .
so what are the lessons learnt : 1 .
don't take your children to class reunions .
"2 . don't leave them alone in the lobby 
"michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother 
"my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie 
"whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance 
"lastly 
"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word ."
""" fun "" is a noun 
"but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run . """
"no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions 
"so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while ."

"the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit 
"part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new ."
""" the wrong trousers 
"but in the hands of park and his team 
"now teaming with co-director peter lord 
"the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) 
"thing is 
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?
"park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious 
"but they're * chickens * 
"another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing ."
"there are references to "" the great escape 
"the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . """
"there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers

"one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome 
"the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults 
the animation is first-rate .
"remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way 
this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .

"anyway 
funnest damn movie i've seen all year .
capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg .
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs .
it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure .
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious .
i had a good time .
"
here goes my credibility .
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority .
i liked the third jurassic park film .
i even liked the second jurassic park film .
"in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world 
"jp2 was an adventure 
that is what all the jurassic park films are .
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house .
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also .
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs .
"the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be 
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds .
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require .
i feel i got my money's worth .
the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica .
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park .
"they hope 
"the height is safe 
the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended .
flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide .
he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs .
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go .
doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs .
they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn .
he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once .
right .
guess what happens next ?
jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 .
first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm .
"sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 
curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance .
"one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other 
they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films .
"of course 
"not only are they more intelligent than in the past films 
"in this story they are not just killing machines 
this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized .
"each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs 
"in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus 
it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright .
perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs .
sometimes they just move too fast to see .
occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision .
"a few times we get unconvincing matte shot 
but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films .
the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film .
"joe johnston 
a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay .
"the film they have made is a long way from great cinema 
"if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today 
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .
"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski 
"either way 
why is this ?
"maybe because you know your life is much better than this 
"director stephen frears 
"when watching high fidelity 
"i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) 
"i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) 
"and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) 
"rob is the character easiest to relate to 
"he uncontrollably cheats and lies 
"and like his other miserable friends 
he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it .
"whatever human emotions the clash 
grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives .
rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in .
"during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on 
but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) .
the plot in three words is : women and music .
the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective .
"it gives high fidelity a quickly paced

what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes .
"john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast

the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended .

"-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa 
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet
review by jamahl epsicokhan --------------------
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side .
"in a nuclear confrontation 
the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs .
"this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe 
""" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) 
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .
five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .
"the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner 
"suddenly out of contact 
"a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost ."
"the plot is compelling 
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .
"general bogan ( frank overton ) 
"the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable 
"a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war 
"most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) 
many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .
"early in the film 
""" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? """
a guest asks impatiently .
""" forty million 
the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war .
the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .
groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .
"yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off 
"on the contrary--according to groeteschele 
such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race .
""" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war 
why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ?
is it wise ?
is it even logical ?
"no 
"although "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism 
"again 
"in addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against 
the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib .
"one of groeteschele's "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd ."
"he labels the average marxist an "" unfeeling 
"groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow 
groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .
the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing .
he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .
"once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible 
"just how will the soviet union's leader react 
( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? )
"with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) 
"without getting into too much detail 
"( that is 
"it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war 
"dramatically 
""" fail-safe "" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) 
"nevertheless 
the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .
"but it was the conscious 
"in retrospect 
"it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down 
"andrew lloyd webber's musicals 
"webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! 
"they instead tackle hot issues from our past 
"like "" jesus christ superstar 
""" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n 
"webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals 
"here 
"it's also a musical 
"the film plays like a rock opera 
"after all 
"they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth 
"this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down ."
"okay 
"i'm not saying the opening moments are bad 
"but what comes after is a lifeless 
"in the musical 
"then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer 
"the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft 
"for a while 
"however 
"from this point on 
"no more punches are thrown 
"we see eva woo and marry juan 
"more importantly 
"juan 
"a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan 
">from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on 
"but despite this 
"that's when our narrator 
"describing this character is difficult 
"alan parker 
"we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should 
his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .
"and there is energy throughout 
"madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly 
"at the beginning 
"her death 
her singing could be better though .
"i know she took lessons to improve her range and all 
she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti
"lupone - i heard her sing on an old "" evita "" cd 
"but it's generally very good 
"antonio banderas 
"his singing is very good 
"he does have a pretty good singing voice 
"and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome 
"although it gets off to a rocky start ( "" rocky "" 's polite for what it really is ) 
"like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's "" everyone says i love you "" ) 
there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell .
"in how to make an american quilt 
"all the sorrows 
motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative .
"the "" quilting bee "" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) 
"the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter 
"she's spending the summer with hy and gladys 
one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast .
"from winona ryder 
"the performances are good enough 
"how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable 
there are probably too many characters .
"so 
"we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy 
"there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life 
the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger .
there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt .
"the stories are all well-told 
"while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals 
"there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way 
"to put it bluntly 
"on the whole 
"finn's segment is by far the most compelling 
the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees .
"if there's a disappointment here 
mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er .
"her mast famous episode 
the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing .
there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies .
so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster .
"and i have to say 
"peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists 
"the first half hour goes into detail 
"despite a few good images 
"it's long and drawn out 
"once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture 
george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world .
he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters .
nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling .
"there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two 
"the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe 
"goes through bouts of sarcasm 
this is when leder starts to show her true stuff .
she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer .
then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter .
"then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city's crowded streets 
mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense .
she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking .
nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero .
you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her .
george clooney is a real movie star .
"many of you may have hated him as batman 
"he has a natural screen presence 
he'll be around for a while .
dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .
i have to say it .
tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys .
"ok 
"no more monkey puns 
"seriously 
"i know 
"and for those film buffs who are fond of the original 
"mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson 
"he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted 
"despite being darker than the original 
some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed .
then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter .
"the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager 
you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement .
touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand .
"lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me 
"anyone familiar with the first version of the film will 
"another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston 
the young chimp goes to visit his dying father .
"both have one thing in common 
"with his dying breath 
that is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret .
the performances throughout are top-notch .
"wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero 
he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet .
this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable .
"roth is ferocious 
he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet .
it is a masterful turn .
"helena bonham carter is ari 
"hers is a smart 
michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken .
"a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo 
"as the battle between apes and humans looms 
"much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton's technical crew 
"burton's musical collaborator 
the movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original .
"he comes close 
"otherwise 
this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype .
urban legend surprised me .
"based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer 
"thankfully 
"you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be 
only person you didn't suspect !
"however 
"it was 
"the thing is 
"maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt ) ."
"or 
"more likely 
i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .
"urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener 
a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .
"one problem 
would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?
i thought not .
"predictably 
"it's odd 
"naturally 
and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !
a decapitation .
it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .
so who is it this time ?
"the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself 
a-ha .
or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?
"like all movies of this nature 
"and it turns out to be 
"i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is 
and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .

he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable .
another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball .

( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface .
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . )
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ?
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old .
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released .
"never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot 
"and also like ted does in all of his reviews 
"before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film 
"as has been made obvious for the last several years 
"george lucas 
"in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order 
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . .
second trilogy . . .
well you know what i mean ) .
"and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which 
"[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed 
"critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies 
"because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy 
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it .
"we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker 
"we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight 
"we also know something about `the force' itself 
"what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy 
"to me 
"also 
"most notably 
"for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years 
"with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga 
"unfortunately 
i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness .
if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) .
but i digress .
i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself .
all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself .
what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s .
"its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar 
"the basic story is rather sorted 
we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo .
"we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is 
"we're introduced to two jedi 
"the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen 
"the leader of the federation 
"he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance 
sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .
"clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film 
i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) .
but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along .
the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .
there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .
"the other films have relied on this type of storytelling 
the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits .
"as we already know 
"and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) 
"to briefly summarize the story 
their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .
"jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force 
this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .
"in fact 
the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .
by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .
"it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology 
not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .
and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .
"it does border of the cartoonish sometimes 
`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .
so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .
but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .
"the story of us 
"well 
"the story of us 
"the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan 
"the film is about two individuals who have come together

"ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer

"fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along 
the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters .

sometimes it's a character sketch .

"on december 20 
"although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years 
"the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly 
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost .
"scream director wes craven 
"and scream's rookie scribe 
it's hard to understate this last point .
"mr . williamson has 
"indeed 
"( i can envision the board of wga 
"and 
"in scream 
"scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood 
"while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived 
"like its predecessor 
"however 
"there are too many knowing 
"flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college 
"the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story 
"they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) 
"the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory 
"there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend 
"any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter 
"as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay 
one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer .
"here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) 
the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements .
( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . )
"indeed 
"this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations 
"while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived 
"they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder 
"it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck 
"in terms of its characters 
their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed .
"on the other hand 
"she doesn't have any compelling presence 
"given this 
what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast .
"the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well 
"( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular 
"but hey 
look what that got her .
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .
be forewarned .
it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth .
"the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history 
"since then 
"with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable 
"while the animation for the film is 
"the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man 
what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions .
"from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric 
"this simple but touching love story 
one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters .
"this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue 
"while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say 
"do we really need to hear 
"is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice 
( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . )
"fortunately 
"chief among them is jodi benson 
( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . )
"similarly 
"he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth 
"pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula 
"in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal 
"of course 
"not only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy 
mr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score .
"it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled "" under the sea "" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright 
"during the song's reprise 
"as of this writing 
"there's no question that the primary motivation for 
"in every respect 
"but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist 
"any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one 
"the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance 
"this christmas 
"although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' 
"it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun 
"`a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season 
"ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood 
evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well .
here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season :
1 ) period detail .
"this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard 
"shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view 
"shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious 
"on top of that 
director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality .
i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like .
2 ) mom and dad .
both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles .
"it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one 
"for instance 
"in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad 
"his performance is richly textured 
which brings us to . . . .
3 ) the comic situations .
there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story' .
"moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing 
"i am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' 
"again 
"the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include 
"i could go on 
"not only is it funny 
i plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition .
why don't you ?
"in intolerance 
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax .
"in magnolia 
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent .
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized .
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve .
"while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along 
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again .
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked .
this creates some strange effects .
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships .
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content .
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends .
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal .
"partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies 
"frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much 
officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place .
jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) .
"the film juggles all these stories for over three hours 
"each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax 
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories .
"the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history 
"magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson 
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company .
john c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture .
particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight .
"here he several of the characters are mesmerizing 
as studies of characters these stories are each worth following .
"as well-rounded stories with a beginning 
but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through .
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .
heavy spoiler . . .
heavy spoiler . . .

during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen .
"and in actual fact 
since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods .
"it is 
the cause is associated with whirlwinds .
"we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air 
the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister .
smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are .
"when the whirlwind is over water 
"essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind 
"so while the rain is possible 
the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs .
it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped .
it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon .
( frankly i have no idea on these points . )
otherwise the event was quite believable .
what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano .
in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 .
""" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people 
"however a rain of frogs 
"note that the previous verse says "" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . 
so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river .
the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 .
contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact .
"four of those times were on the big screen 
"the same can't be said for films like independance day 
"contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) 
"her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age 
"while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) 
"ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist 
"in puerto rico 
"despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" 
"it's a weak and hurried relationship 
"meanwhile 
"this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors 
"it is in this nm city where 
"when the signal is closely examined 
"eventually 
"the media swarms 
"as if that weren't enough 
contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion .
"the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented 
"arguments for both sides are intelligent 
"when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) 
"the question is 
"even when the film wraps up 
don't get me wrong .
"as much as it sounds like it 
it's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours .
"despite its seemingly heavy issues 
"the special effects are outstanding 
highly depreciated on the small screen .

"the storytelling is rich and complete

roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton .
"this italian film star 
"but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love 
the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore .
"like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him 
he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government .
"instead 
in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter .
guido wins dora .
they marry .
fast forward about five years .
"guido 
guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore .
"but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy 
the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp .
"here 
it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched .
"for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror 
"true 
"unlike steven spielberg 
his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child .
"for guido 
"giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 
the winner takes home a tank .
"therefore 
he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him .
guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates .
"guido 
"throughout their imprisonment 
"ultimately 
"in a poignant scene 
"the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight 
the price for his victory is most high .
"benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell 
"life is beautiful is a fantasy 
it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust .
those who object to it are missing its point .
"and that is simply where there is hope

larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company .
"the people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine 
"based on a true story 
woody harrelson gives an excellent performance .
he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus .
"by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves 
this is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court .
"however 
"larry flynt's wife 
"larry meets althea at one of his clubs 
"both of them indulge in a world of too much sex

althea had joined him in taking the drugs .

"courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea's situation 
it's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away .

there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime .
"the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also 
"even so 
director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' .
this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this .
"although on the face of it

"similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth

"i have a problem not with the story or story structure 
"for the first hour or so 
"but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while 
"also 
perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner .
there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers .
i was half-right .
nevertheless it's worth-seeing .
"the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action 
"the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films

"a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things 
"oh 
sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture .
he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do .
i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course .
one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line .
"in malick's three hour bore-a-thon 
"it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass 
"sure 
raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters .
"i think most viewers may miss the comparison 
"and then there's billy bob thorton 
"if it can continute to produce people like thorton 
he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here .
"it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade 
"jacob is slow and simple 
i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said .
here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry .
"though the plot is somewhat unoriginal 
paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) .
"perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife 
a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming .
"but at least this one has an important message 
"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater 
"when the movie was over and the audience was exiting 
"simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys 
"simon is a dwarf 
"surprisingly 
"simon thinks god has a plan for him 
"joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) 
"simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem 
"even his own parents don't care about him 
"he is also harassed in church by the local pastor 
"the only person 
"it would be just simon's luck 
"joe 
"with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) 
"most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny 
"simon will also look for god's plan for him 
"starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor 
"jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off 
"this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway 
"simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson 
"he does an outstanding writing and directing job here 
the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat .
the cast is excellent .
joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance .
"joseph is outstanding for someone of any age 
"ian michael smith 
other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast .
"i loved this movie 
"take your whole family to see simon birch 
"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be 
"in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint 
this movie closely resembles a james bond flick .
"it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it 
"kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie 
the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests .
"as a young boy 
"that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name 
he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be .
"this leads to a devestating mistake 
"kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak 
"during a press conference 
"once his mission is completed and he is safely home 
"when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million 
"dr . emma russell 
"this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia 
"the only problem is 
this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal .
"tretiak hires him to steal the equations 
one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions .
"they are very convincing 
"kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more 
"when the two meet 
"yet 
"shue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together 
"when she finds him 
"the saint is very action-packed 
the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments .
"along the course of the movie 
"these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous

"rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film

the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days .
"all of the people involved are just characters 
"douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours 
"along the way 
"the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going 
"i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz 
"unfortunately 
"the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere 
"sometimes it was hard to believe that this story 
"i know this isn't a true story or anything 
"on the plus side of acting 
"in the thirteenth floor 
"another plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance 
"don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor

"the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the "" reality check "" based movies for awhile ."
i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding .
"it contains parts of bringing up baby 
"it is cute 
one of the bad guys was a surprise .
"the pace is fast enough 
i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick .
julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together .
"i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking 
"her hair 
she could use some highlights .
"they both do fine with their roles : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot "" cub "" reporter with the chicago globe ."
they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie .
i like the one story focus .
"other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss 
basically this movie is reasonably fun .
"there is a serious mystery to solve 
it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously .
i do give successful comedy high marks .

"but one thing leads to another 
"a lot of ass-kicking 
critique : very cool !
"now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for 
"the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) 
tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film .
he is pure evil .
they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man .
"what a great 
"my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole "" kiss of the dragon "" thing to him and he cut him off by saying "" kiss my ass ! """
pure action movie poetry .
"anyway 
"actually 
"fonda was also pretty good 
"but in the end

i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club .
"a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way 
"in his films 
mrs .
"doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems 
"while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence 
doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy .
"williams stars as daniel hillard 
"one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) 
"unemployed 
"he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) 
"daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) 
"mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work 
"the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel 
"it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film 
more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's .
perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes .
there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask .
"fortunately 
"during the film 
"after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing 
doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place .
"daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful 
"clearly 
"it took putting him in drag 
"he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire 
"wisely 
"his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty 
it's one of mrs .
"doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect 
"as miranda 
"the children are also good 
the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing .
it's easy to see mrs .
"doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over 
but mrs .
"doubtfire manages to carve out its own space 
there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs .
"doubtfire 
and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change .
"weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple 
"in the truman show 
"it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character 
"by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him 
"`seahaven' 
"for 30 years 
"thus 
"in a few broad strokes 
this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it .
"for all his madness 
"truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be

synopsis : it's 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york .
"disco music is popular 
"in fact 
"as in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip 
the cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam .
"no one knows who the son of sam is 
all around new york people are different .
aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals .
in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) .
"vinny's friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco 
ritchie's girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut .
"everyone's different 
"unfortunately 
opinion : director spike lee's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer .
nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him .
"it's about differences and how 
one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex .

"for example

"existenz has been called "" a gooey matrix "" 
"the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal 
"a major difference is that "" the matrix "" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality 
and oh what a reality it is .
"david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch 
maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre .
"technology is organic 
cars are normal .
gas stations are the same .
cell phones are glowing bug like appendages .
"you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a "" pod "" ) ."

"sort of a hole in your spine ( ok 
"luckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) 
"after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station 
"the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies 
"but the plot 
"cronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap 
"and that's the true joy of this film 
"you learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh 
"there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around 
"also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz 
"there's lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter 
"it all adds up to a supremely far out trip 
"oh wait 
good films are hard to find these days .
great films are beyond rare .
"proof of life 
"a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting 
consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world .
"i haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece 
"but enough with the gossip 
"the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) 
"upon discovering his identity 
"the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off 
"with no choice available to her 
but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands .
"the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue 
"the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations 
"the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan 
"dug out from b-movie hell 
"ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes 
the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes .
"the bulk of those scenes 
the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise .
director taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film .
proof of life is a thinking man's action movie .
"it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war 
"i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity 
the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity .
"i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre 
"maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role 
"maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity 
but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life .
the story of serendipity is simple .
"two people 
"charmed beyond repair 
"but with each of them already involved with other parties 
"sara declares that if this "" thing "" -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen 
"years later and on opposite coasts of america 
"what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity 
"fortunately 
coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity .
both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters
"on the flipside 
but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture .
"in some regards 
"try too hard 
"in simon birch 
"in the end 
there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich .
"he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown 
the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) .
"simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital 
"joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) 
"naturally 
"in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith 
"joe doesn't quite buy it 
"early on 
both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability .
"the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon 
"finally 
mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic .
"the script is loosely based on john irving's novel 
"along those same lines 
by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same .
"simon birch is a different look at a different life

here's what the two movies do have in common . . .
"--scenes of intelligent 
reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three .
crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist .
the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated .
"instead 
most of the movie's running time is spent with mr . white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive .
"mr . orange 
"the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon 
"the story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks 
"eventually 
let's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear .
"a lot of the time 
"the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to 
another scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana .
"neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop 
reservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction .
it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching .
all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails .
and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ?
and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon .
"a computer whiz-kid 
"but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game 
instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad .
"with the help of jennifer 
i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema .
it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed .
"of course 
i wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares .
i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon .
broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) .
"but the rest of the actors are 
"david's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s 
"if for no other reason 
david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers .
the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on .
"far from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem 
the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today .
what are the lessons we can learn from wargames ?

"ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish

"to see a ship fall apart 
"the effects are so stunningly realistic 
"but titanic is more than a disaster movie 
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise .
i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you :
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic .
"we see actual footage of the sunken ship 
"bill paxton leads the expedition 
"what he finds instead 
"we meet rose ( kate winslet ) 
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love .
"we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) 
"the two meet under interesting circumstances 
"add in a jealous fiance 
"i must add 
she is a pleasure to see on screen .
"when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film 
the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on .
the effects are tremendous .
"from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room 
"we saw titanic in dolby digital surround 
my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard .
"when people are in the water 
titanic runs far too long .
the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length .
"and 
don't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's
not a bad as i am making it out to be .
it really is an exceptionaly well-made film .
"the costumes and sets are incredible 
"the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form 
"this film will certainly win on effects 
cameron has certainly made his best film to date .
"unfortunately 
it just doesn't have a strong supporting story .
it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside .
it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for .
i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews .
it is a film worth seeing .
i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office .
"with its extreme running time 
this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts .
"titanic opens december 19th 
i give titanic 3 stars ( .
that's not bad .

i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted .

"back to men in black ( is it just me 
"i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard 
"okay 
"few people know this 
"this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever 
"kind of weird

so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years .
good question .
i'll move on to the movie now .
"as you probably already know 
"men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear

"with the success of the surprise hit alien 
"in fact 
"handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron 
"instead of being a suspense/science fiction film 
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created .
"a film like aliens comes along only once in a while 
"i never saw this movie in theaters 
"the terror and fright must have been unimaginable 
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen .
"with a science fiction plot 
"in fact 
"perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine 
"never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film 
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about .
"placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual 
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended .
lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened .
"she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens 
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left .
"despite stern warnings from ripley 
"however 
"one of the company's directors 
"this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) 
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony .
"arriving on the planet 
"the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn ) ."
"ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become 
"ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened 
"aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version 
"alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member 
"aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens 
"then again 
"he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin 
"it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes 
"with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film 
"i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout 
"just when you think the movie is over 
"with a seemingly endless conclusion 
"this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film 
"using flawless special effects 
"of course 
"aliens is completely realistic 
"the special effects are wonderfully seamless 
"one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music 
"horner has created a terrific score 
"not only that 
"in fact 
"the production design is incredible 
"dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive 
normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer .
"then 
some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley .
"surprisingly 
"sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley 
"weaver soars above the rest in this film 
"carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child 
"lance henriksen is terrific as bishop 
"jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role 
michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film .
"however 
"paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director 
"a very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film

"rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded 
"rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned 
"jon voight plays leo f . drummond 
will rudy defeat leo ?
will he enjoy being a lawyer ?
"opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending 
director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie .
"in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it 
"however 
'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters .
in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general .
two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be .

"this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy

taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role .
we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building .
"his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd 
technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production .
i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects .
one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain .
the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice .
"with a clever subtlety 
the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd .
but it's us being clapped .
we are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show .
"the music 
and it works very well .
the 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play )
helfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people .
indeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women .
his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft .
it shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home .

steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production .
the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war .

spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes .
"private ryan is not for everyone

"we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice 
for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget .
"the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 
"well 
so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era .
"with 'twister' 
i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' .
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in .
i've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't see or think that once during the entire film .
i get bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute .
"another thing 
you know what ?
"i couldn't give a bloody damn if it's possible or not 
it's a freaking movie and i don't want reality thrown in my face .
"i want to be able to see the impossible

"however 
anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful .
"he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "" magnolia's "" scenes drag on too long ."
any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending .
from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring .
it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot .
this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation .
every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees .
"for example 
"the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes 
anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing .
the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously .
this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get .
"the performances in "" magnolia "" are perfection ."
this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting .
"anderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best 
all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film .
"worth noting is tom cruise 
he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife .
she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film .
""" magnolia "" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters ."
anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours .
to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity .
diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time .
i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .

the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy .
"when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv 
his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care .
first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name .
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination .
his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements .
"bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church 
he is hit hard with questions about his voting record .
"he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots 
"since he's a dead man anyway 
"they made some promises that improved their public image for a while 
"the shock and outrage from the congregation grows 
"( before i go further 
"fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth . """
that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie .
"when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics 
the experience is liberating .
"with nothing left to lose 
he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway .
"why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists 
"bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church 
he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something .
"chicken wings 
bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives .
"when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings 
"with so much money and so many talented people working so hard 
"( you go 
"when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product 
"that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub 
"he stays up all night drinking 
"the next day 
"from then on 
his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy .
"he's not very good 
"his lobbyists are not amused 
"eventually 
"overtakes the politics 
screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him .
"there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes 
"these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along 
"still 
"as the story and screen writer 
"as an actor 
as a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) .
"someone else probably could have directed 
it's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics .
"after all 
just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants .
just don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies .
"american pie acknowledges a cold 
"its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) 
"jim 
"after a party at their studly friend stifler's ( seann william scott 
american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds .
almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee .
all women are there to be ogled .
( alyson hannigan's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . )
"situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience 
( to arouse : nadia's ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence .
to amuse : jim's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . )
"what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies 
"two more standouts : klein and "" sctv "" 's eugene levy ."
"klein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row 
i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon .
"levy's is the most crowd-pleasing performance 
american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up .
"it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes 
"the picture ultimately has a healthy 
the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible .
"for its familiarity and for its charming leads 
"as far as the new teen cinema goes 
* don't say i didn't warn you about the party scene .
the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy .
"but after diasappointing films such as "" godzilla "" and "" fear and loathing in las vegas "" 
but i doubt you could have expected this .
"the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen 
"there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim 
"the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction 
there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show .
"it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame 
carrey has made a very wise choice .
"by playing mild-mannered truman burbank 
that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes .
truman burbank was born to an audience of millions .
he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show .
"everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians 
everyone in truman's life is an actor or an extra .
"they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe 
but he is the only person that is not aware of it .
the classification of the truman show may be tricky .
the audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter .
i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character .
"the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes 
so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ?
a drama ?
it really depends on the audience .
"but to me 
"but above all else 
"oscar predictions in june are pointless 
one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length .
"if a film is only 90 minutes 
"but if a film last 2 1/2 hours 
boogie nights falls into the latter catagory .
"the director 
"mark whalberg 
"marky mark 
"jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director 
"after running away from home 
"in the movie business 
"we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce 
but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing .
"the direction is fast 
"there are some great shots 
"the writing is fabulous 
"boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing 
the soundtrack is also excellent .
"like american graffiti ( 1973 ) 
"also 
the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties .
"the film 
"firstly 
"in both scenes where he has to act angry 
but the rest of the cast are excellent .
"burt reynolds is brilliant 
"another flaw with the film 
"it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit 
"it's a shame 
but they're small niggles really .
boogie nights is an excellent film .
"superb directing 
"whatever you do 
it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film .
"films such as aliens 
the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films .
"the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional 
"for years 
i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on .
"but after countless searches in laserdisc stores 
until now .
"the film follows the story of l ? on 
"he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman 
"one day 
"taking pity on her 
"mathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a "" cleaner . """
she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession .
"at this point 
"the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda 
i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle .
the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops .
"there's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot 
"with these additional scenes replaced 
"the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes 
the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema .
"my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional 
"director/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson 
"while it was part of former yugoslavia 
"words "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard 
"the rare exception was the dogs of war 
"in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people 
"same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business 
"the movie protagonist 
his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro .
"shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba 
"after being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police 
"upon return 
shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war .
"thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies 
"it shouldn't surprise anyone 
"those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers 
"this one deals with soldiers of fortune 
"unlike wild geese 
the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda .
"christopher walken played in many movies 
"his performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking 
"his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned 
"although the movie doesn't lack capable actors 
"however 
"this was the first major production for john irvin 
"with the good script he can make very good movie 
"luckily 
irvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel .

the happy bastard's quick movie review
analyze this
how does one do a comedy focused on the mob ?
"well 
failed to really get the joke .
"this time around 
for plenty of reasons .
the story goes like this .
"a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late 
it's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two reasons .
"first 
"and 
"fortunately 
"director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity 
"deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy 
( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . )
"crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character 
"kudrow is also a hoot as crystal's wife-to-be 
is the movie perfect ?
"not really 
"kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show 
"line of the movie : crystal : "" when you said you needed family therapy 
"this is a film about secrets 
"others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship 
"and 
"receiving a summer grant to study "" chemo-electric therapy 
"he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab 
"his main argument is 
"that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster 
"he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially 
"the third view in all this is the artist's 
"she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public 
"geoffrey 
"while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car 
"in the dinner scene that was 
"the scientists engage in a rational argument 
it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies .
"that the director's point of view is absolutely right 
the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters .
"geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster 
"alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian 
"geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy 
the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely .
"the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it 
"the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage 
the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way .
what is progress ?
what can one expect out of life ?
is the small farmer about to become extinct ?
"the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art 
"that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions 
no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic .
"there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me 
"that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit 
the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high .
"perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film 
it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him .
"both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world 
"the pain that lillian feels 
"perhaps 
this british import follows the ( mis- ) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths .
"there is marc renton ( who narrates ) 
"powered by a top rate 
"some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction-esque 
the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title .
i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen .
it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4 .
the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors .
"this is a very original film 
it definetly deserves multiple viewings ( partly because of the slang and accents ) jeremy dennison mr . orange@centuryinter . net
"you may not have heard of lucas 
"probably because it stars corey haim 
"however 
"corey haim stars as lucas bligh 
one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him .
"her name is maggie 
"maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her 
"they gradually become good friends 
"lucas is obviously in love with maggie 
"this is not clear to lucas 
"he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate 
we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally .
"they throw him on stage 
"surprisingly 
the next scene is brilliant .
maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally .
she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened .
"he rails back against her 
in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters .
but maggie is written smarter than that .
she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him .
next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) .
he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend .
what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks .
of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next .
cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship .
this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone .
she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt .
"maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor 
"this scene is so delicate and sweet 
"desperately trying to puncture the tension 
it's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) .
lucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance .
"this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself 
the last third of the film revolves around this attempt .
"while the idea seems cliched 
there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up .
"dave grusin's memorable score 
lucas is filled with great performances .
forget everything you know about corey haim .
"back in 1986 he had talent 
"kerri green is very appealing as maggie 
"sheen's cappie is almost too good to be true 
"there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben 
"also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina 
"when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s 
lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics .
"but hopefully 
"it deserves more than that 
"in arguably the most anticipated movie this century 
"despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down 
"in terms of characters 
she is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' .
"she not only has a presence 
"no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force 
"the young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene 
in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners .
"i mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change 
"not much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods 
"also fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian' theory 
and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force .
"more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader 
overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor .
by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan .

first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix .

and life is never so bad that it can't get worse .
"if you're familiar with altman's work

"and so 
"but 
there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky .
nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched .
"however 
a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness .
jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film .

"unfortunately 
"they remain little more than placeholders reading "" insert friend here "" ."
"of the adults in the film 
"the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child's dreams 
director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge .
"however 
scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial .
"however 
"the problem with many so-called "" uplifting "" films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat ."
"october sky never resorts to that level 
this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar player/musician/composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members .
"all the rest displays a compilation of footage 
"other footage shows backstage foolishness

frank's guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix i've ever heard .

"while watching boiler room 
both films consist of a predominately male cast .
both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires .
"and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator 
"while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club 
a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire .
"paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street 
"as is true in real life 
boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages .
another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks .
"some people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence

"after stumbling into a room at the wrong time 
"at this point 
"ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin 
the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves .
the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film .
the supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless .
"ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company 
the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring .
the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens .
there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable .
"due to the lack of a major event 
"the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller 
"in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole 
it doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into .
one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better .

"movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious 
"maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions 
"the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if

the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots .

"when you really think about it 
look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend .
"growing up 
"one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) 
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold .

just fill in the blanks !
can you see it ?
""" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief

"however 
how does he tell his name to another ape ?
""" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? """
"well 
"but hey

isn't that illegal in most countries ?
"oh 
i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore .
tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical .
"there's lots of music to be sure 
"we instead get more of a phil collins concert 
"this isn't really a bad thing 
"do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system 
"with each new feature 
"not necessarily by leaps and bounds 
"there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect

'nuff said .
"you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal 
two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities .
nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence .
"ephron 
"ryan is kathleen kelly 
"their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film 
"for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast 
yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan .
and the two are kept busy .
"one 
"hanks has his decent guy routine down pat 
"ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable 
"their scenes together sparkle 
and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe .
"the sparks created by the earlier movie are 
"true 
the ephrons' script is witty and sharp .
"however 
"some scenes drag

"overall 
"it's a nice holiday movie 
committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades 
"even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark 
"on the other hand 
"this film is amarcord 
the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense .
"instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs 
"although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator 
"amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film 
"every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film 
"distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect ."
"in the same way the word is distorted 
"after the premiere 
fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film .
even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images .
"characters look like caricatures 
"every now and then 
"because of that 
even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy .
"when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents 
"unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s 
lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters .
"each of them 
"fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection 
"because of this warmth and democratic spirit 
fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie .
"vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera 
"fellini also knows how to use locations 
"even the down-to-earth streets of rimini 
"on the other hand 
this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota .
"his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable 
that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .

star trek : first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina
"star trek : first contact ( pg-13 ) anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the "" even-odd pattern "" --the even-numbered installments of the series are good while the odd-numbered ones are

"this is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else 
"the other half of the title--first contact--refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st-century earth 
"while this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end 
"not helping matters is the tiresome cochran character 
"in the end 
"the story is typical sci-fi fantasy

"based on the entertaining success that is star trek : first contact 
slavery is bad .
"after hundreds of years 
"this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film ."
"during the late 1830s 
"fifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners ."
"freeing himself from his chains 
"after killing most of the crew 
instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states .
the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy .
the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property .
"if they are property 
their masters ?
the spanish government ?
salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ?
the us government ?
the defendants are pawns in several games .
"abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them 
their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees .
south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states .
president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends .
"when the verdict looks to free the africans 
even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims .
"at the urging of calhoun 
this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court .
the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg .
"much like his "" shindler's list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) 
nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human .
it's not hard to see who the bad guys are .
"without that question to ponder 
he has to make the story interesting .
spielberg succeeds for the most part .
the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach .
where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle .
there are very few _people_ in the tale .
"in fact 
"tappan and joadson are "" abolitionists "" : symbols but not humans ."
van buren is a weak politician but nothing else .
"the rest of the "" slaves "" barely exist other than dressing for the set ."
"like many other films about people of color 
the film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou .
the former model's first major role is a winner .
"without speaking more than five words of english 
"the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in "" nixon "" ) ."
the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen .
there are some other great moments .
especially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land .
their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant .
"as grand as the epic is 
more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film .

in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s .
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time .
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life .
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker .
"philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original 
"the right stuff was the last of them 
the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film .
"the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story 
"the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film 
"that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents 
"sam shepard is great as yeager 
"on the surface 
shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn .
"young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper 
always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard .
"kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey 
"royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher 
great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction .
most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time .
"the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert 
everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world .
"in that setting 
"but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war 
"their entire lives become focus of media frenzy 
"this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity 
those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language .
"editing is great 
"although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military 
those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space .
"another fine contribution of this film is "" oscar "" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it ."
it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy .
some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period .
"this film is great 
"some of the "" mercury "" astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors

"on the other hand

so paul agrees and the race is on .
"but then 
"her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications 
"well 
"in election 
almost everyone has their own agenda .
"no matter how deeply hidden 
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school .

"that is much of this film's beauty 
matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role .
"his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film 
"of the two acting jobs 
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon .
"the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her 
broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes .
one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day .
"you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures 
"and his subtle disgust with her is apparent 
the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience .
but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part .
"however 
this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency .
she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed .
"if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools 
but don't you dare think that election's goals are similar .
"it is just as real in its portrayal of high school 
there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here .
the rocky horror picture show 'special edition' ( 1975 )
starring : tim curry and susan sarandon
cult films are never mainstream .
"the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused 
fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they're insane .
"the rocky horror picture show 
period .
"like some other cult films 
this movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining .
they go to a castle to try to use the phone .
"little do they know that the castle is owned by dr . frank n . furter 
the acting is pretty good overall .
"tim curry ( home alone 2 
"it's interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon's ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet 
even the singer meatloaf is in it ! !
the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way .
"a sampling of titles range from damn it 
all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing .
"barry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon 
meatloaf sings like meatloaf .
the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version .
"sadly 
"if you want to see a different film 
"confession time : i have never 
"i don't know why 
"haven't wanted to check it out on video 
"so right up front 
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ?
maybe that's going a little bit too far .
"as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie 
but . . .
the parallels are there .
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor .
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors .
"gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story 
"they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines 
"ok 
so titanic's not in gwtw's league .
no matter .
"titanic is a great movie in its own right 
"much has been made of the humongous cost of the production 
the money was obviously well-spent .
"the costumes look great 
"i especially liked the expensive little touches 
but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects .
cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in .
he succeeds masterfully .
cameron does two things that work incredibly well .
"first 
"the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state 
"television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) 
"stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role 
"secondly 
"the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast 
"cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack 
"the supporting cast is professional 
"( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform 
the love story itself is rather conventional .
"i think some reviewers found it weak 
the performances are the key here .
"zane has the meatiest part in the movie 
"he's smooth 
"at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat 
"but "" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? """
dicaprio is a revelation .
"i hadn't seen him before in anything 
"( honestly 
"dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive 
"from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg 
"winslet's character grows up a lot during the movie 
"at first 
"we know from the narration that she's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane 
winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg .
it's at that moment where winslet's character really comes alive .
"faced with real danger 
"as rose and jack race around the doomed ship 
"of course 
"cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic 
cameron's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well .
"if he doesn=92t watch out 
"of course there are still a few big guns in this film 
"although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses 
"in ron howard=92s latest film 
"mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom 
"a veteran of numerous hard-nosed business negotiations 
the casting is what puts this film over the top .
"the trio of gibson 
sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark .
his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h . g . wells=92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of=
"society . mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below

his cowboy=
"tactics tend to work 
"in a round about way 
"as sinise says "" you=92re a payer ."
"you did it once and now you=92re going to do it again . """
one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities .
"lindo calls home to talk to his kids 
"even the kidnappers are real people 
gibson=92s break-down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective .
it=92s one of the best filmed representations of a man=92s world falling apart that i=92ve seen .
it=92s not all perfect .
"the shoot 'em upending 
"as well crafted as the scene is 
"mullen=92s wife ( rene russo ) has several good moments 
"while adequate 
but you=92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one .
"forget about the large coke 
john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles .
"so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there 
"example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert 
"was a lot of fun ( which it is ) 
"i muttered 
"she responded with her usual query 
this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see .
"if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light 
"anyway 
"now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies 
"i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him 
"at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes 
"cu-sack . cu-sack - no 
"i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) "" ."
"he's not a brand name 
"with his pleasant 
from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon .
"despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) 
"and he knows how to chose scripts 
"high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters 
"it was also co-written by cusack 
"it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film 
"high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob 
this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off .
"at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed 
he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us .
"gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study 
"though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable 
"the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d 
"he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before 
"but i like this guy 
"the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes 
he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films .
( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) .
but fears and black never let that happen .
"the character 
"he's over the top 
"catherine zeta-jones 
"tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type 
"the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy 
"i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role 
"this reminded me of say anything 
"in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his 
high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances .
"fears' direction is somewhat stilted 
"but cusack really does deserve an award 
i'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent .
"his character 
"only a year after the initial release of "" scream 
"while the tongue-in-cheek 
"the first film 
"the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab 
i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy .
"its conclusion 
"the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general ."
"although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and 
"everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning 
"more importantly 
"the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact 
"understandably 
"couple that with the fact that several of the characters 
"we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and 
"while i have not seen any of his other work 
"unfortunately 
"for example 
there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction .
"as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor ."
.
.
"well 
"i gave the first "" scream "" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up ."
""" scream 2 "" bounces all over the place stylistically 
"i'm not sure which is the better movie 
"the full monty is a whole lot of fun 
"it's written and directed by relatively unknowns 
how did this movie with a budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide ?
its been rumored that this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year !
"and to think its about male exotic dancers 
six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs .
"inspired by the success of a chippendale's production 
"as the six team up to put on the show of their lives 
"for instance 
"so when the night of the show comes 
"as i said before this is a fun movie 
the writing and direction are great .
"the acting is appealing 
the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture .
"which left me wondering one thing 
"while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy 
"still 
"with the release of gattaca 
"hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films 
and good characters . . .
"and good acting 
"and for some reason 
"the closest 
"now comes gattaca 
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening .
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering .
"using this premise 
"unfortunately 
"since seeing the film 
"lately 
most people don't even realize that it is a film .
"despite this fact 
"niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter 
gattaca begins in the 21st century .
"procreating is now done in a petri dish 
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned .
"we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) 
"one of the directors of the program has been murdered 
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman .
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love .
"however 
"as a result 
"anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws 
"vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan 
"labeled an "" in-valid 
"german introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident ."
"jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine 
"in exchange 
"after the murder 
"irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca 
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time .
only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them .
"unfortunately 
the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs .
"the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive 
"the sets are very well done 
"as we look at the designs 
this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day .
"the best thing 
the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller .
"at its heart 
perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring .
would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ?
maybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws .
"if we get rid of flaws 
"niccol's intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well 
the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters .
"while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol's part 
"ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor 
"his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and "" valid "" peers ."
"uma thurman is . . . well 
"her character is slightly underdeveloped 
"however 
jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character .
"he provides several nice touches 
loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character .
dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie .
alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank .
"still 
"gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles 
"gattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images 
"despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film 
"it turned me off slightly 
"if this had been a typical hollywood film 
"however 
"instead 
whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ?
hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca . . .
and hopefully audiences will too .
p . s . personal note to p . j . gladnick : how dare you call this film the worst film of the year .
i can't even begin to image what film you do like .
that frightens me beyond anything .
"it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle 
and so it is .
"_the truman show_ is the most perplexing 
don't credit carrey .
"it starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) 
"the story 
"( ironically 
who knew ? )
"one-upping niccol 
"weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone 
it was weir's first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame .
"for example 
the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island .
credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey .
"carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn "" on "" and act goofy whenever the camera is near ."
not here .
his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on .
"and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well 
playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey's life .
no pun intended .
"better in a smaller 
it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman's well being .
"yes 
he thinks .
rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs .
"dalloway ) as carrey's true "" forbidden love "" 
laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman's wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development .
"the exception is at the very beginning 
there are other little problems with the script .
are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ?
"was there any reason as to why in one scene 
"how is it they hire hundreds of extras 
"and couldn't christof have turned off the wind 
"these little contrivances 
"the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show 
the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut .
"upon leaving the theater 
just checking .
"now 
there was the unforgettable jaws .
the exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) .

"this time

this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday .
jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin .
as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him .
he has become an unquestioning weapon .
he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is .
but even assassins have innocent pasts .
he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school .
complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime .
a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin .
"calder is a familiar actor in britain 
he was seen in the world is not enough .
here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years .
he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake .
"his lair is underground 
it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet's life .
"paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair 
by using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world .
this is a world that is cold and unfriendly .
sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see .
this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach .
we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that .
"the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross 
it creates indelible images of evil .
i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .
"( i do hope they do not use the tagline "" don't mess with mr . in-between . "" )"

"essentially 
"however 
"believe me 
i'm just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as .
but perhaps i'm reading more into the movie than is really there .
maybe the film's brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit .
"in fact 
most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy .
"rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category 
"the rocky formula of "" rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight "" is carried out to the letter ."
also the 'tradition' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well .
this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . .
even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! !
then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) .
"a mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he "" pities the fool "" for not coming out and fighting him outright ."
"rocky's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight 
"naturally 
somewhere along the line after this several things happen .
"rocky's longtime trainer dies 
rocky's wife complains to her husband that he should fight .
the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky .
guess who wins ?
the winner's name rhymes with 'smocky' .
the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang's over the top performance .
the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film .
which is good if you like fighting scenes .
the last match is quite decent actually .
"if you liked the previous films 
it's well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series .
"but if you can't stand rocky shouting "" adrianne ! ! ! """

"trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics 
"naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and 
"the thing is 
jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze .
"ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done 
it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ?
"what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law 
"coming into play is another 70's veteran 
"max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system 
"also involved is ordell's "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) 
"fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role

"penn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre

"at first 
"but then 
"nicholson is fantastic 
"penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast 
"only eckhart disappoints as jerry's replacement

"it all builds up to a shattering 
one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film .
his american buffalo is a set-bound piece that has very little plot .
sometimes he will tell a story that really moves .
heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work .
"unlike his the spanish prisoner 
heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games .
"it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double-cross whom 
"watching the film's team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either "" what the heck are they doing ? """
"or "" why didn't anybody think of that before ? """
appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job .
"it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay 
this is a robbery that works like a well-oiled machine .
there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore ( played by gene hackman ) filmed on a security camera .
now joe has to get out of the business .
it was coming time anyway .
"joe's team including bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) 
but crime boss bergman ( danny devito ) is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery .
"and he has to take along a young kid 
immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye .
much of what distinguishes heist is mamet's dialog .
remarkably it serves a double purpose .
the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet's special feel for dialog .
"hackman has lines like "" everybody needs money ."
"that's why they call it money . """
mamet's timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production .
"the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score 
"both are good films 
but at least on a high level they are much the same story .
the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them .
"i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 
that made the subject matter just a little too timely .
my understanding is that the release will be delayed .
my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon's acting at times seems very poor .
"it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection 
it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller .
it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .
'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses .
see contact with your family .
it is a movie for all ages .
--a review by stuart cracraft
"contact starring : jodie foster 
"after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) 
"by the end 
this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies .
"however 
"hadden ) 
hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) .
"this one 
this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation .
foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms .
"early scenes take a long 
the movie's pacing is very good and subtle .
the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful .
the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however .
"one of the most entertaining 
there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored .
it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters .
everything else was very one-sided ( e . g .
foster ) .
lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table .
the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega .
"it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach 
"in another sense 
"the concept is not new 
"but the beach scene 
"freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki 
"as the movie gains speed 
"it is certainly oscar-caliber acting 
"the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos 
"in fact 
al .
"got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie 
but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons .
the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not .
"also 
"contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan 
"perhaps now 
"like the wonderful 1990 drama 
"since "" awakenings "" was so very good 
"the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) 
"at the hotel she is staying at 
"amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not 
"once she has returned to new york 
"at first reluctant 
"ultimately 
"he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him 
"on the basis of the overall story 
what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance .
"however 
"usually 
the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil .
"the massaging sequences were strangely erotic 
"these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known 
the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board .
"val kilmer 
"it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity 
"mira sorvino 
"although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's "" mimic 
"in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil 
"kelly mcgillis 
"finally 
"the one misstep of "" at first sight "" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil ."
"very little is ever said or discussed concerning it 
"perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences 
"in "" awakenings 
"because of how strong the screenplay 
"the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is 
"since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies 
"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because 
"it angered people 
it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film .
"having endured my share of the hype 
does men live up to its press ?
"well 
and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .
"for the uninitiated 
"chad and howard are archetypes 
"chad is the blond golden boy 
"howard is chad's boss 
we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .
"there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office 
the reason ?
"both men have recently been dumped themselves 
""" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives 
"howard 
"they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) 
"chad moves in for the kill 
"howard follows suit 
"flattered to have the attention of two eligible men 
you can guess which one she falls for .
"soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad 
"adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high 
"in chad 
"his evil is as subtle as a viper's 
"we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers 
"his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad 
he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .
"if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns 
"politics is his game 
"men wears the guise of a black comedy 
"the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company 
the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .
could it happen in the real world ?
probably not .
"taken as allegory 
"maybe it's just the english major in me 
the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .
the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .
but does the film work as entertainment ?
"its darned funny in spots 
"it works less well as drama 
"stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine 
"likewise 
by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .
certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .
"but the picture is often mesmerizing 
"like all good films 
"while watching chad in his moment of triumph 
"there may be a little bit of chad in all of us 
"the booming introduction music finishes 
"we see two figures looking over a barren 
"they kiss 
"one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips 
the glass on his mask cracks .
"his face scruches up 
"then doug quaid 
it's all been a dream .
"he wakes up next to his beautiful wife 
total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot .
"quaid 
"one day 
"quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory 
"the implant goes wrong 
"however 
"quaid 
he get's his ass to mars .
"mars is ruled by cohagen 
"against him are the rebels 
"the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen 
"eventually 
"throughout this plot 
"naturally 
"as you can tell 
"but it's done so stylishly 
the acting is variable .
"arnie 
"stone 
"but 
"ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) 
"one minute she hates quaid 
"so 
"but 
"cox is basically reprising robocop 
"ironside is superbly evil 
"the supporting cast are fine 
"one disappointing aspect 
ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good .
"some of the model heads look appaling fake 
another irritating thing is the product placement .
"there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however 
"there's also a good soundtrack running through 
"overall 
"for a schwarzenegger movie 
"in fact 
"jonathan demme's _beloved_ 
"on the one hand 
"on the other hand 
"this choice is a smartly made one 
"indeed 
"_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century 
"for newly-freed slaves 
"oprah winfrey is sethe 
"what she did not know was that it would follow her there 
"_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness 
"the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape 
"invisible hands terrorize her family 
"sethe's sons run away 
demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects .
all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real .
"when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions 
"instead 
"as in morrison's novel 
"sethe is the one being haunted 
"in fact 
"the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) 
sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health .
"they know not who she is 
only paul d is suspicious of the stranger .
"little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes 
winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset .
she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show .
"lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe 
"danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d 
"as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs 
the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself .
"thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first 
"departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ 
"totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films 
"_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing 
"for the most part 
"this 
"though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well 
nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer .
"morrison's novel is just as enigmatic 
"the movie begins like _poltergeist_ 
"taken as a whole 
"scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor 
"death -- even gruesome 
"and 
scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously .
the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise .
"the unexpected blockbuster 
"a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately 
"as stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film 
"paradoxically 
"there is blood 
craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids .
a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter .
"after all 
scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original .
"as in the first picture 
"this time 
"some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that 
"shortly thereafter 
"craven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the "" movie within a movie "" sequences ."
they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache .
"stab features heather graham in the "" casey becker "" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as "" sidney prescott "" ( neve campbell ) ."
"sadly 
"it would have been a little more fun 
"following the prologue 
"her friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well 
"once the double murder at stab becomes big news 
"at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) 
"she has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) 
"also arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) 
"in addition to the survivors from the original scream 
"there's a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar

alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off .
"the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher 
"without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings )

"featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) 
"it's one of the most memorable moments 
and this is where alien 3 succeeds .
"fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films 
"fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it 
alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images .
"by doing so 
"many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake 
"showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch 
i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron .

"fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) 
"many critics didn't like all the actors being bald 
"most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story 
"the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films 
"again 
"however 
"as a result 
"this creates a lot of tension 
"as an alien film 
the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters .

"sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance 
"she was snubbed at the oscars for this one

"lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii 
"the rest of the cast is pretty stale 
"alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language 
"although it has its flaws 
this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie .
"while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films

the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 .
the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 .
"included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star 
"campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty 
"such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead 
"also 
"for that scene 
"almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before 
i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track .
the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all .
"don't get me wrong here 
"sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask "" have anything to say sam ? """
"to me 
"also 
"well 
"also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's "" gala "" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film ."

"much of the film deals with elizabeth's love for lord robert 
"there is much ado about her lack of a husband 
"the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece 
i didn't much care about the characters ( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett ) and so i didn't have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials .
"the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen's most loyal advisor 
"why then 
simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer .
kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin ( neither of whom i have heard ) create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side .
"the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches

"they are horror fans 
"you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn

"that scene works because in a normal horror film 
"the plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell )

"that and the references to horror movies

"i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie 
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others .
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie .
warning : major spoilers follow !
"please do not read 
you have been warned .
the x-files is what a summer should be .
"exciting 
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank .
"from start to finish 
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon .
"this flick is scary 
"in fact 
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !

if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ?
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous .
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill .

the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation .
"there is no time to take a breather between scenes because 
") the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots 
"who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ?"
so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose .
"but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie 
what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ?

"wilhelm furtwangler 
"what were his views 
how much did he know about crimes against humanity ?
the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation .
"
"in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine 
"szabo's follow-up film 
it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them .
ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich .
"maj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) 
"when other artists fled germany 
after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes .
he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty .
from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra .
as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation .
there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting .
perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed .
"if so 
in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler .
where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous .
it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act .
when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation .
"perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe 
we are given clues to something but they are never tied up .
in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler .
the film is basically a stage play .
the visual is not very important .
corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location .
"as with a stage play 
i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .
[there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice .
"at one point we clearly see arnold's desk calendar say "" jan 16 tues . """
a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 .
the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 .

"and while obviously made on a modest budget

hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible .
"in some cases 
"billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick 
"crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian

"i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out 
"unfortunately

"as marcellus

"richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role 
i think he had two lines .
then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway .
"when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year 
"if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome 
hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one .
branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images .
"this only works about half the time 
"you don't have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare 
"the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar 
"in it 
or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .
the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings .
"involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) 
he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own .
marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel .
hank's reaction is one of amusement .
he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how .
"the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her 
"typical of the mental illness 
the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable .
"from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing 
"carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe 
the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum .
"after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) 
"carly openly flirts with the co . hank tries to deal with the situation 
arguments ensue .
the family becomes even more alienated .
"the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers 
"back at home 
"one daughter says 
"the other answers 
"it reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy 
she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open .
"hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives 
he confronts the c . o .
but not about carly .
he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing .
a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife .
hank is arrested .
what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co . he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation .
"instead 
he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters .
carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time .
the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems .
the performances are solid throughout .
jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife's rage .
he comforts her and offers protection .
lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family .
amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should .
blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family .
the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) .
the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 .
he had made such classics as look back in anger ( 1958 ) and tom jones ( 1963 ) .
orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years .
the film joins an alread promising fall line-up of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone .
the happy bastard's 30-second review :
american pie
"the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest 
"if you go expecting dawson's creek 
"if your expectations are lower ( and better 
"the movie casts several unknowns 
the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid .
that's pretty much it .
"throughout the movie 
"of course 
"most of the actors get their job done 
"i couldn't stop laughing during this movie 
"if you're one of those "" conservative "" types 
_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction .
"if you haven't heard of it 
first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ?
"well 
"it's a good film 
"when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" 
"i mean 
"gads 
"i was not entirely filled with anticipation 
"it's when it came out in the cinema 
"i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) 
"so i went with a slightly more open mind 
did i ? yes and no .
"mainly yes 
"the first hour or so was beautifully done 
"the film is told via flashback 
: - ) ) .
"well 
does it work here ?
in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story .
"what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart 
"her presence brings a much deeper level of passion 
"also impressive are dicaprio and winslet 
"it's an old story 
"in fact 
"it's engaging 
"there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well 
which leads us to the second half of the film .
we all knew it was coming .
"i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it 
"i think that understates the importance of the romance 
"the iceberg arrives 
and it is an hour .
"my goodness 
"gratuitous ? well 
but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be .
"not that i'd expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such 
is it overdone ?
i thought so .
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy .
"no 
"still 
"you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved 
"perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk 
"the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand 
"i loved the ending 
"so 
haven't mentioned the script .
"plot-wise it's ok 
"as for the dialogue ? well 
it's a period drama .
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .
"did they really use phrases like "" goddamn it ! """
back in the turn of the century ?
i doubt it .
"would someone talk like this : "" do ya love the guy or what ? "" ."
i doubt it .
"is such dialogue as "" i saw the iceberg 
yes it is .
"a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray 
"stick with directing 
"but its more than redeemed by the acting 
"star of the show was gloria stuart 
"after all 
directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job .
"like i said 
i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score .
"utterly heavenly 
; - )
"i've finished my rant 
just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ?
"hell 
bloomin' farce .
"it was deserving in a number of departments 
"last question ; is it 
"nope 
"it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen 
"and as for the fact they're reportedly making a "" titanic 2 "" ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you !"
"in some respects 
the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone .
the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble .
all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element .
the duo must always be completely mismatched .
the hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone .
"however 
rush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) .
"proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) 
"still 
this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west .
"jackie chan is lee 
"or 
"despite the necessary conventions of action films 
"jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen 
"chris tucker 
"however 
"perfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture 
"when he is in action 
"still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case 
"chris tucker's character may come across as irritating 
"since he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan 
"while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare 
"while not necessarily poignant 
lee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' )
"when contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick 
"while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike 
"with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs 
"as well 
"my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times ) 
"this is exactly what happened in this movie 
the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) .
william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president .
there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago .
he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead .
this movie was exceptional for many reasons .
one being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together .
"they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly 
"also 
it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) .
experience counts for a lot ! !
"in 
they claim that he's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them .
he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over .
"so he turns to his "" best "" friend 
on the way over to jack's house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ?
"when confronted 
""" she doesn't do any actual writing 
steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she'll take steven on as a new client .
"jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present 
"after the meeting the muse 
steven's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon .
"steven confesses everything and 
the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her .
and that's a question only time will tell .
""" the muse "" is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( "" defending your life "" and "" mother "" ) ."
"the problem lies in the script 
it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential .
"but 
"he may whine and complain 
and i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it's a nice change of pace for her .
"and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner 
"and although "" the muse "" doesn't have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman's "" the player "" i still left the theater feeling good ."
and that's something i wish i got out of more movies .
"plot : good ol' texan kid suddenly gets to play first-string quarterback on his high school team's football team 
"the coach is just about the biggest a-hole you'd ever want to meet 
the good ol' texan boy does not approve of said man's methods .
critique : a fun football movie .
"this film was obviously geared towards the teen market 
"having said that 
"i actually thought this was a comedy going in 
"i also enjoyed jon voight's performance as the stubborn dick coach 
"this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination 
"all in all 
you could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys and girls running around doing their stuff .
and did i mention the t&a ?

little known facts about this film and its stars : james van der beek actually started acting after a concussion stopped him from playing football in real life .

"the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director

i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people .
"i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant 
"i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt 
in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film .
"it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 
it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan .
"since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 
i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film .
no words can describe the dvd .
in 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 .
"now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield 
the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut .
why is he stalking her ?
check out halloween ii it explains it all .
"on this unholy night on october 31 
the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk .
"nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job 
"what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film 
the movie is flawless if not perfect .
"no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one 
'halloween' will be like 'psycho' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later .
i just hope someday 'halloween' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition .
"'halloween' isn't just another slice-and-dice horror flick 
see 'halloween' and be scared . . . . then
watch it again !
"reviewed by brandon herring october 7 
i have to admit that i disliked this film initially .
"it certianly isn't for every taste 
"that said 
"this was my second favorite movie of 1998 
perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality .
"i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very 
"on my second viewing 
the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of .
"it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness 
and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) .
"the majority of the film is one extended battle scene 
"the artsier elements do not detract from the action 
"the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to "" saving private ryan "" in my opinion ) ."
"they're brutal 
"the second act is as immersive 
the only problems come during the first and third acts .
malick takes a little too long to get the film started .
"although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol 
"the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning 
"the final act is effective at winding the film down 
"that said 
the performances are phenominal all around .
"the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel 
nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation .
"his character is hard 
"caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war 
"he is absolutely perfect - genuine 
"although restricted to a relatively small role 
"as to how it stacks up to "" saving private ryan "" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 
"it's really hard to compare the two - they are so 
"however 
"i highly recommend both of them 
"all in all 
it's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right .

"nelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan's dominance in the world market

it's occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes .
"i usually don't buy those cheesy "" i love you dad "" segments in movies

"frequency's creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended 
what would i do ?
would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated ?
or stop some kids from shooting other kids ?
or buy stock from yahoo ! ?

the only difference worth noting is that frequency's final scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making .
there are some problems with the film though .
"first 
the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently ( no pun intended ) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story .

"synopsis : in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma 
"the setting is after the first world war 
a nine-year-old orphan named little tree ( joseph ashton ) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa ( james cromwell ) and his native american grandma ( tantoo cardinal ) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee .
here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life - - and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise .
everything is miraculous to a child .
"but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u . s . government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma 
"through his childhood experiences 
"opinion : this excellent 
it is one of those priceless screen gems that nobody knows about because it's not highly advertised .

the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army .
"the only male in mulan's family is her father 
"mulan

"mulan 
"wong 
but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in
"typical disney fashion 
"much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame 
"sure 
"the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good 
"but 
the animation is on par with some of disney's best .
"the story itself is interesting 
"the musical score to the film is enjoyable 
"at least 
mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date .
most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) .
"there's nothing graphic 
children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies .
it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition .

capsule : the world will come to an end at midnight .
everyone knows it and must make a final peace with the last hours of their lives .
"this is an intelligent science fiction film with no special effects 
"
- it is the last night of the planet and several different people are reacting each in their own way to the end .
the film covers 6 pm to midnight .
the main character is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote and directed .
- reminiscent of on the beach .
"but much more so of a story richard matheson wrote 
( p . s .
"on rereading the 1953 matheson 
"the similarities may be mere coincidence 
- us release may be problematical .
"the title is lackluster and non-memorable 
also provincial americans may not care about the end of the world coming to toronto .
they probably would feel it would not affect them .
perhaps a pbs release would be possible .
- patrick's family has declared it christmas and are hurt that the ( adult ) children will not spend the whole evening with them .
- grocery stores mostly looted .
it seems though that one of everything is left .
"- some people continue business as usual 
some people are in total denial .
"- much comedy 
- very canadian cast .
- it does not get dark .
it is just always daytime .
"- radio playing "" last night i didn't get to sleep at all . """
how appropriate .
- david cronenberg as a kind of bland functionary manager at the gas company .
genvieve bujold as french teacher visiting former student .
"- science fiction film with no special effects 
- the person you have been thrown together with by chance becomes the most important person to you for the rest of your life .

"from this point on 
this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out .

"and if you suspense buffs aren't already sold 
"with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures 
"no doubt 
"but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story 
"obviously 
"everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric 
"overall 
"but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one 
"like the series of games 
"it's the year 2065 
"whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors 
"while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a "" zeus cannon 
"while the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well 
"it's unfortunate 
perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script .
"some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english 
"nevertheless 
why do these aliens feed on souls ?
"if they can pass through bodies and ships 
"what is so special about the "" spirits "" that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ?"
"worse yet

"the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming

"starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars

it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications .

roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be .

penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety .

"jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino

"jackie brown is the result 
"despite excellent direction from tarantino 
"pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown 
"more than likely 
"describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult 
i will tread lightly .
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport .
"the camera tracks along with her 
"we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) 
for a hefty price .
ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away .
"however 
"they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) 
"they try again through brown 
"but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda )

"ordell doesn't like this 
"this scheme seems to be going as planned 
"revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown 
"tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) 
"his hitmen are normally cruel 
"they talk like normal people 
"of course 
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop .
"of course 
"things are told from one person's perspective 
"this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion 
"on the technical side of jackie brown 
"however 
"the writing 
"the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction 
"his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation 
"perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard ."
"the dialogue is pretty much intelligent 
the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good .
"and as with pulp fiction 
the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable .
"the performances are incredibly rich 
"nothing is quite as it seems 
"the real treat 
"her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits 
"watching grieg 
"her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad 
bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato .
i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) .
"michael keaton comes across very well 
"chris tucker has a small 
"samuel l . jackson is very good 
but no matter . . .
jackson is very strong in his role .
"robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times 
"robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film 
"he is present throughout most of the film 
"jackie brown is rated r for language 
"as a film by itself 
"however 
"when compared 
"it's a worthy effort 
perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress .
"i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! )

- excerpt from twister production notes
i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before .
"i for one 
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable .
"it will suck in cars 
"basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister 
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers .
"these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences 
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !
jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes .
"while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon 
"apparently 
"he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days 
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented .
"the problem is 
"to add to their current challenge 
"thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek

"there is the danger of the twister 
"helen hunt 
"thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) 
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences .
"like his previous film speed 
audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen !
the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister !
( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie .

there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort .

"he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will 
"it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter 
it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film .
"the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment 
"we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life 
washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth .
"he doesn't merely play angry

""" the hurricane "" moves quickly 
"jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is 
"his boxing scenes 
"jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform

contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel .
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) .
"we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico 
"her research is quickly killed 
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r .
hadden ( john hurt ) .

it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world .
"of course 
"( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" ) ."
"to boil it down 
"drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god 
then hadden reappears with startling news .
"he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie 
"ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels 
"when she returns home 
"she was not even gone for one second 
"her story is officially discredited 
.
.
eighteen hours worth of static ) .
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first .
ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working .
"neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs 
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures .
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally .
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble .
"hadden obviously has affection for ellie 
"even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) 
"the film is technically impressive 
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain .
"the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme 
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved .
the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith .
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures .
"rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle 
another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) .
"the only really fleshed-out religious person 
i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian .
all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex .
"the film drops the science ball at the very end 
"in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist "" religious "" doctrine 
"in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith 
"what ellie should have said was 
"not without evidence 
"i know what happened but you shouldn't take my word alone . """
that is the voice of science speaking .
the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film .
his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position .
"also 
the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles .
"the media figures 
"the use of bill clinton 
"first of all 
"also 
"people watching this film in the future will say 
this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief .
"also 
better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all .
"the film does raise an interesting question 
"if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture 
"personally 
i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task .

"it's a cold 
it doesn't look like a place worth even thinking about .
"david cronenberg has been the creator of "" the fly ""

"the way the words fade in and out 
"the killer's victims have no connections at all 
they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense .
we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown .
not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this .
the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect .
"let's just say it seems a little too "" mystery movie 
"when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe 
"this is a typical thrilling element 
"if anything 
"i don't have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal 
"there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives 
what's even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is .

"after having viewed titanic 
"there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic 
titanic tells its story in two time periods .
"it starts out in the present 
"what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace 
"the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett 
there she tells her story to lovett and his team .
"in 1912 
"she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) 
"on board 
"although for rose the attraction is not immediate 
"the story sounds very simple 
"dicaprio is marvelous as the young 
"his is a character that is immediately likable 
girls are going to swoon over him .
"winslet also proves herself a good actress 
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing .
"simply by judgment of her gait 
"rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess 
"billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal 
"his features are such that even when he smiles 
"he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher 
"like dicaprio and winslet 
"backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy 
"no matter who else is in the cast 
"additionally 
nice to see dr . bombay getting work .
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die .
"this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic 
"in this way 
"you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop 
"as i mentioned before 
"the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail 
"with regard to the exteriors 
"cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank 
"could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater 
also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning .
"we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship 
"these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening 
"in all 
"the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements 
"in box office receipts 
it was easy to fear the worst .
"begin with a classic 1960's television series

"who needs one 
we've got ourselves a formula .
that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction .
"then 
didn't .
"the fugitive is as lean 
"under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) 
"expect box office to go through the roof 
the premise is a simple one .
"dr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer 
"after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry 
his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him .
"where the fugitive surprises the most is the script 
"in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic 
"in an early sequence 
"on his way out 
"it's a small moment 
"later 
"it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught 
credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators .
"the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence 
"the action is crisp and brutal 
special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads .
and what a pair of performances those leads are .
"tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard 
"for the first third of the film 
"it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent 
"instead jones plays him as a sharp 
it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence .
it's his job to bring in a fugitive .
this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form .
"the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford 
"for his entire career 
"however 
"the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing 
"this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films 
"however 
the chase is on .
my advice is to catch it .

this is because times change and in response people change .

this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents .
"even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past

they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored .
this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another .

"all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue 
the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense .

catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up .
"she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma 
"as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her

a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours !
initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix .
"while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes 
"the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . 's "" losing my religion "" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story 
"despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments 
"all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher 
"the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best 
"if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant 
"the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images 
"in my opinion 
"the newton boys 
"the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though 
"detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film 
"besides the nipple ring removal i mention above 
a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting .
one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device .

"the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic 
in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children .
"animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies 
let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off .
dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group .

"danny glover is the voice of jethro

"the movie 
the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life .
demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice .
"at less than half of that 
we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket .
"we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) 
moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew .

50's `aliens vs .
earth' idea revamped !
"if you have been following the movie news over the net 
it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary .
"id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july 
"the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens 
"the movie opens via star wars 
the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth .
"the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist 
"capt . hiller ( smith ) 
"his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders 
id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses .
acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) .
"no prizes for guessing how id4 ends 
"id4 borrows heavily from star wars 
"if i were to critically review this movie 
"however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws 
"an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie 
"id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million 
"some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable 
id4 is a movie for all .
"though there are many explosions and implied deaths 
"sit back and don't be too critical 
"if you are not planning to watch any movies this year 
this film is best watched on the big-screen .
the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily .
three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making .
they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house .
"from there 
"i can say 
"although i know it was all a staged "" mockumentary "" 
i didn't feel much upon initially watching it .
i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts .
i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend .
i've gotten chills every time i've brought it up since then .
this is not a movie that hits you right away .
"instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine 
this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch .
"the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film 
this is as real as it gets folks .
"i don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though 
"the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real 
"this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing 
the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen .
"word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes 
i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd's .
i know i'll be first in line to buy one .

"apocalypse now 
a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film .
"in many ways 
apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made .
"in addition 
"apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l . willard 
"captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with "" extreme prejudice "" because he has been deemed a murderer ."
"willard accepts his mission 
"accusing someone of murder in this situation is like "" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 "" 
it doesn't make too much sense .
escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat .
"the men are chef ( frederic forrest ) 
"willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is 
"the men encounter many exciting 
but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore .
kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf .
surf .
this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson .
"duvall's portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific 
"eventually 
one of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard .
but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony .
"kurtz is actually well aware of willard's mission 
"yet willard is intent on completing his mission

kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love .
"merton 
"but kate's "" job "" 
"her father lost all of her family's money 
"naturally 
"kate leads him on 
kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice .
"at a party 
"kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie 
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup .
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it .
"he is still in love with kate 
"the three of them 
let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton .
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate .
"kate loves him but can't marry him 
"a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying 
at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies .
"millie will leave her money to merton 
"she lets merton know of her schemes and 
kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together .
merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her .
he's not sure he can separate the two .
kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else .
the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved .
"without revealing the details 
the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament .
one is left with feelings of regret and despair .
"what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed 
"an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over 
a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after .
"their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other 
"i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir 
"as i have acknowledged before 
"roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end 
"millie's part didn't require as much range 
i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion .
"their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically 
"still 
"earlier this year

ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael .

every viewer is sure to like both of them .

"this appears quite inconsequential until the end 
"overall

the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff .

"what follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal

he demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro .
it is fine work for one of such a tender age .
keep your eye on this young man .
the supporting cast is also quite effective .
"toni collette 
"twenty-eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script 
"it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan 
"in giving the sixth sense a favorable "" three star "" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit 
"there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the "" living dead . """
the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself .
"the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve 
that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages .
scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . .
an event which has not yet occurred .

mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt .
"so he puts a couple of bullets in mel 
"but 
"to make matters worse 
"his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters 
payback is often a very violent film .
"to its credit 
"the film appears a bit disjointed in places 
"when the director refused 
so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end .
"it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain 
"in this case 
"but hey 
"my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role 
"gibson is gibson 
he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance .
"this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast 
the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) .

little known facts : this film was kyle maclachlan's first non-david lynch foray into the world of feature films .
his first two movie appearances were in lynch's wretched dune ( 4/10 ) and the sensational blue velvet ( 8 . 5/10 )
i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture .
i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies .
"and i think that lumet's "" 12 angry men "" 
"but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents ."
the film is set in burma in 1943 .
a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .
"but the british commanding officer 
"struggling toughly 
afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .
"he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale 
"but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge 
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .
"and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" ."
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito .
"in this regard it is symptomatic that shears 
the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men .
( the plot by-passes these risks . )
"that means 
but it has a lot of virtues as well .
"it shows the "" madness "" of war and what war can produce in people's minds ."
it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .
"and "" the bridge on the river kwai "" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests ."
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .
"david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense 
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .
the other actors deliver very good performances as well .
jack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful .
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay .
"it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) 
"the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes 
"the first 
"they talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) 
"after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage 
"they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell "" ."
"i won't reveal the rest of the story 
"the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge ."
"previously in the film ( like i said 
"as it turns out 
"he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend's apartment 
"on his way home 
"the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers 
"scene from "" deliverance "" ."
"the last ( and best 
"they seek help with a friend of jackson's ( played by the q-man himself ) 
"they end up calling a "" cleaner "" of sorts 
"in the end 
"if you haven't already seen the film ( or even if you have 
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen .
"earlier today 
what the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable .
"that version cut out 
what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing .
"for instance 
this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place .
just a theory . . .
one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e .
""" psycho "" "" kiss me deadly "" 
but why shouldn't he ?
it's not like he out-right and blatantly stole .
give the guy a break .
"in case you haven't already noticed 
"trust me 
"and besides 
"note : if anyone knows how i could get a "" bad motherfucker "" wallet 
any help would be greatly appreciated .
there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did .
""" lucky numbers "" is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of "" fargo "" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me ."
i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain .
"the film takes place in harrisburg 
john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards .
"russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) 
"she's a selfish 
"crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) 
"she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them 
"much like "" fargo 
"he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) 
"along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named 
there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down .
i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting .
"this is a farce 
"where as "" fargo "" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny 
"it's all a big cartoon basically 
"travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character 
he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill .
"crystal is just the opposite 
"kudrow is perfect in this role since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on "" friends . """
here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe .
i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money .
"like "" jackie brown 
the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus .
"more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic 
the ending itself is great .
it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good .
you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) .
"i liked it 
"this summer 
"on january 3 of this year

"this is mississippi ! """
"as beckwith 
"meanwhile 
both deserve serious oscar-consideration .
this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin .
"let's face it 
"and baldwin is living proof of this 
it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear .
"either poor acting or poor directing 
"another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg's facial features didn't change 
yet woods' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg's father .
at least the make-up was realistic .
"with some emotional moments in the poorly written script 
"don't get me wrong

"it pauses for a moment before the "" field "" cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment 
"compare that scene 
"the scene in "" the sweet hereafter "" epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film ."
it's not sensational .
"we don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming 
the bus doesn't explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces .
it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake .
it's a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance .
"using a non-linear approach to his narrative 
"fourteen children died in the accident 
"the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) 
"stephens 
"while stephens' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) 
"his self-destructive 
egoyan's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry .
"mychael danna 
"equally impressive is paul sarossy's cinematography 
""" the sweet hereafter 
it's a film of generous subtlety and emotion .
losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing .
reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare .
"while we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view 
this isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city .

she falls under max's wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting .
"kirshner's credits are relatively small for now

"i wouldn't mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts

"( oh yeah 
"now 
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa .
"i'm not saying that in a bad way 
"however 
"being mormon 
"trouble is 
and i like it !
"wild things is a film noir of the 90s 
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color .
"the actors are all gorgeous people 
"sure 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it .
"there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see 
"wild things begins at blue bay high school 
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) .
"of course 
"immediately 
"we can turn off our brains 
wrong .
"while you may be expecting one thing to happen 
"the film begins in a classroom 
"there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) 
he's heading the class discussion .
"there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) 
"teaching the class 
( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) ' .
""" what is a sex crime ? """
ray asks .
""" not gettin' any ! """
one student responds .
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch .
"however 
"and so 
"quickly 
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him .
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep .
"surprisingly 
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists .
"and what's more 
"going along the way of scream 
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen .
"and even though you think you may get tired of them 
"going back over them in my mind 
"thankfully 
"as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well 
this is pretty much just one trashy film .
"however 
"it's good trash 
"one 
"this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) 
"bill murray also provides the best character in the film 
"and two 
"wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) 
"instead of having heterosexual sex scenes 
it's not as graphic as you might think ) .
"the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic 
"it's very brief 
"and 
"also 
what first made me want to see wild things was its cast .
"neve campbell 
"here 
the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) .
campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent .
you can tell she will be around for a long time .
"denise richards will also be around for a long time 
"here 
hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability .
"and then there is daphne rubin-vega 
"she gives a very good performance 
towards the end she does get a bigger part .
"on the male side 
"kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character 
"you must have admiration 
"and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot 
and then there is bill murray .
"his performance is the comic relief 
"as a whole 
"director john mcnaughton 
his direction is smooth and stylish .
"the visuals are striking 
"however 
"his fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant 
"the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this 
"then 
"this was probably the most obvious thing to me 
"it's hard to describe in words 
it's wonderfully composed and presented .
and be sure to stick around during the closing credits !
mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) .
he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events .
"some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot 
"plus 
"wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality 
"again 
so why not give it to them ?
"neve campbell 
"the sex scenes are graphic 
one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating .
"the language is quite harsh too 
and i can't stress it enough : don't allow kids under 18 to see this film .
"the target age for the movie is the 18-24 range 
it's definitely not for those under 18 !

the postman delivers but not first class
the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman
"[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories 
"even worse 
read the following with those particular grains of salt . ]
it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart .
"due to a world war in the late nineties

this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants .
food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile .
shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item .
"although the postman knows he's running a fraud 
the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny .
the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner .
"although the movie appeals to my sensibilities 
"it's derivitive of costner's own "" waterworld "" and clint eastwood westerns ."
there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before .
the film is often down-right corny .
a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality .
the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor .
"despite the film's excessive three hour length 
what was the war about ?
how did civilization change so rapidly ?
everyone has horses : where did all they come from ?
"the "" law of eights "" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film 
are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer ?
there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense .
"the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments 
"the evil army is called "" holnists "" which sounds coincidentally like the new age "" holism "" 
"is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 
"why is the general named "" bethlehem "" ?"
"there seems to be some reason for that 
sometimes the movie feels like a joke .
an army of postal workers armed with guns ?
"considering the headlines of recent years 
it's even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes .
"given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government 
"even with its numerous flaws 
"it's doubtful that "" the postman "" is going to find much of an audience 
besides we're all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug .

"and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer

should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ?
"this appears to be one of the million questions in this film 
"i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all ."
"it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments 
"the acting is amazing 
"we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) 
there are tons of individual moments that i adored .
"i loved all the comedy in the film 
"i liked the relationship between some of the people 
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch .
"and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal 
"like the break-up scene between will and skylar 
"however 
"the film tries for deeper relations between the characters 
"take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems 
"we hear how they went to the same town 
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do .
"also 
"we see them joking around 
"their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends 
maybe it was just me .
"and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau 
"and 
"we never understand what they see in each other 
"minnie driver is interesting 
"the writing is a bit at fault here 
"sure 
"the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh 
"i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue 
"while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of "" to die for 
"and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws 
"i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating "" comedy "" of chris tucker ."
"i'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium 
it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title .
the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects .
"this time around 
the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns .
"of course 
rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it's carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out .
i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan .
he refuses to shut up .
"not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head 
"i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates 
if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don't care to see any more of his films .
"fortunately 
"it's not often that one actor can so completely save a movie 
"much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a "" player 
i can think of few high concepts that are funnier .
"the movie ends with outtakes that 
"chris tucker botches some lines as well 
a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn't very different from its predecessor in tone or style .
"but i liked the original 
director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) .
"it's not great jackie chan 
up next : jay and silent bob strike back
"some critics 
"since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen 
"bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry

"raging bull is the perfect counterexample 
"the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta 
"for all 129 minutes 
"historically 
"however 
"the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base 
sex and violence are inextricably linked .
the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull .
"in the ring 
"outside of it 
"the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife 
"these are the two who mean the most to jake 
"he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity 
"raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta 
"over the years 
"meanwhile 
"vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife 
his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him .
"hence 
"( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? "" )"
"in the late '40s 
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing .
"two years later 
"by the late '50s and early '60s 
raging bull is the other side of rocky .
sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 .
"it won the 1977 best picture oscar 
"but 
"while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man 
rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased .
there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance .
"in a career that has included many fine roles 
the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering .
"and 
this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting .
"as the younger jake 
"as the fat 
how many actors would go that far ?
the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance .
cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) .
their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's .
"pesci 
"the misogyny and violence are still there 
"but 
"moriarty 
"later 
"scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few "" home movie "" segments are in color ) ."
"the choice is perfect for the movie 
"( one important recent exception 
"in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) 
there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas .
"during fight sequences 
"scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta's loss to sugar ray 
"after that 
"yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment 
the reason is obvious : scorsese isn't as interested in boxing as he is in the character .
"following his retirement 
we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self .
who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando's speech from on the waterfront ?
"( "" i coulda been a contenda . "" )"
perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the '80s .
"and 
"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita 
"when seeing this film 
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution .
"what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita 
"this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film 
"i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time 
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting .
"the second time 
"the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one 
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach .
"its protagonist 
"the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology 
"these ideas are all worked into this film nicely 
"the focus of this film 
"the tone of the book is a comical one 
"humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires 
we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed .
"he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love 
"he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions 
"the story recognizes the extreme of this 
"the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end 
"the opening and final images of the film are the same 
"this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen 
"in that film 
"the studio demanded the final scene 
"when you see it 
"the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the 
"looking at these two versions 
"they both go for different things 
"and although it's true that several scenes are similar 
"i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is 
"however 
"it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes 
some of that is in the casting of the two leads .
"jeremy irons 
"he's droll in a very unique way 
he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience .
"and when he looks at lolita with love 
"and dominique swain 
"she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original 
"it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention 
"when he denies her something 
"there are two other minor characters in the film 
"the former is charlotte 
"in the book 
"and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal 
"as played by shelly winters in the original 
it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first .
"and even though griffith is not really bad 
"the other is clare quilty 
langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original .
"quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms 
"langella takes the other route 
"as you can see 
"this version is beautiful 
"the camera movements are stylized 
"the acting is for the most part wonderful 
"more importantly 
"by the end 
capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . .
but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs .
most comedies these days have one flaw .
they're not funny .
"they think they're funny 
"occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people 
liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny .
"this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct )

"there is one thing he takes seriously 
"but his wife is divorced and seeing another man

"then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday 
he gets the wish .
what happens next is sidesplitting .
"everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change 
i'm not giving you any money because i know you'll spend it on booze !
"all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! """
he can't even get into an elevator without earning a black eye .
"and what's worse 
"carrey 
he uses it to great effect in this movie .
"there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there's a grin breaking out across my face right now 
"he can't even write the lie ; his fingers twitch 
"equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don't ask why ) 
this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end .
the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end .
"a shame 
why is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ?
it's not even part of the movie's real agenda .
"thankfully 
"maybe they were being merciful 
"if i'd laughed any more 
"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month 
because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great .
"underneath the to-die-for cinematography 
it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point .
it goes from character to character .
"it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all 
"it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball 
"in short 
"it merely tells its story really well 
director anand tucker tells this story well .
"he overdramaticizes everything 
"the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson 
"they are also both musicians 
"jackie 
"when they both hit adulthood 
"they marry 
"she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist 
"it's all terribly melodramtic 
"the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister 
"their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world 
"when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities 
"when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man 
"and the whole time 
another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance .
i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) .
my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job .
"the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure 
"hell 
"in that same exact movie 
"she has to actually deal with real emotions 
but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons .
"if you don't believe me 
"this isn't so for watson 
"and thanks to the opening sequence 
"rachel griffiths 
"griffiths 
"after all 
"she does 
"together 
"if it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) 
"it's so close to perfection 
"but 
"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail 
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online .
and i wonder : is that so bad ?
"well 
"as for the movie 
"to paraphrase james berardinelli 
"they are both wonderful 
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ?
"meg ryan 
"she's had a handful of memorable performances 
"but 
"she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks 
"some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples 
all i know is that i just like them both .
"they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist 
"they're just really 
"hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron 
"here 
kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her .
"she is successful 
"she is also having an affair 
"you see 
"they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics 
"ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) 
"fox books has decided to open a store on the west side 
"every morning 
"it's a charming premise 
"it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra 
this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love .
"hmm . well 
"you know it's going to happen 
"thankfully 
"it's all cute and wonderful 
hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is .
"he is 
does he show it here ?
nah .
"but he's still tom hanks 
which is what this movie boils down to .
it's pure confection .
"all the bits about the godfather 
"there are some immense flaws 
"the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked 
"once hanks knows the secret 
"i even looked at my watch a couple times 
the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated .
e-mail ?
"when my kids are my age 
"but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody 
"they just work together 
"it gives you 
"the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious 
i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was .
"i've always believed that movies are very powerful 
"you see 
"movies can definitely do the first two 
"i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint 
and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had .
"hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan 
he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment .
"tom hanks and meg ryan are magical 
"it's a sweet 
"it may be a long commercial 
are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ?
"director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film "" next stop wonderland "" ."
"the two main characters 
is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ?
does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ?
"as the film starts 
"rather 
"arriving home from work 
"in a fumbling 
"it's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand 
he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief .

"eventually 
"alan

"later 
the movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing .
there are several subplots involving alan .
"one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium 
another subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track .
a distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off .
the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy .
"thankfully 
"the film moves along at an unhurried pace 
co-writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships .
the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over .
"when alan and erin eventually do meet 
"it's a sweet 
"the disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair 
"the film's inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one's life makes "" next stop wonderland "" a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions 
"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga 
"of course 
"however 
"in short 
""" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one 
"of course 
"so back we are 
"so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy 
"once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) 
"also on board are a band of mercenary pirates 
"there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley 
oh well .
"well 
"and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya 
"of course 
"the real focus of the series seems to be on style 
what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach .
""" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights ."
""" aliens "" is a wild 
""" alien 3 "" is a bleak 
""" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film 
"jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner 
"the chills in the film are really cool 
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that .
this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others .
there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed .
one is the aforementioned surgery scene .
"another one takes place between call and ripley 
"the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense 
"and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) ."
"but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) ."
it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga .
"the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work 
"however 
"and 
"johner : "" well 
"but not this ship . "" )"
"the acting is good all around 
"winona ryder is good 
"of course 
"playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional 
"she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens 
"overall 
"the style is the best part of the film 
"but it's entertaining as hell 
"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship 
"wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature 
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise .
"the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) 
and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began .
"it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine 
"in the film 
"structure-wise 
"this is no "" kane 
"instead 
"the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy 
"but the 70s scenes are engaging 
"they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era 
"instead of creating the world the way it was 
"there's no outside world to speak of 
"haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero 
"blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop 
"through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) 
"haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur 
"even the brief music videos 
"the best sequence 
"in it 
"with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background 
"it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on 
"this movie's not so much about plot 
"however 
the music is especially notable .
"the soundtrack 
"the cast is rather impressive 
"although eddie izzard 
some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes .
"rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era 
"in fact 
"bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood 
"nevertheless 
"at the prime of the movie 
"their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging 
"the story of stuart 
"as a cultural rock piece 
"it never totally takes off 
"it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments 
"the beginning is captivating but slow 
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ?
"it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past 
"still 
"the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks 
"when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been "" updated "" i shuddered ."
i thought that yet another of shakespeare's classics had been destroyed .
"fortunately 
"baz luhrman has directed an "" in your face "" 
"it revolves around the two rival families 
these rival companies/families are the capulet's and the montague's .
"the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs 
"as the storylines goes 
"i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film 
"of course 
"so they marry in secret 
"the story 
"the cinematography is spectacular to say the least 
there is very little to criticise .
"the performances are convincing 
the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever .
"despite the well known storyline 
krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy .
"done poorly 
"however 
"professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) 
his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea .
"however 
"his wife has recently died 
"tonight 
"rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) 
"however 
"soon 
"his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague 
krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief .
"no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras 
"luckily 
"though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe 
"the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable 
richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe .
"jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times 
"even the kids 
"yes 
"it may not go down as an all-time classic 
"not since 1996's shine 
"in fact 
"yet hilary and jackie 
"emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale 
"both musicians from childhood 
"the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women 
"their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's 
the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance .
"they contrast each other wonderfully 
"the frank cottrell boyce script 
the script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature .
cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame .
"the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least 
some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised .
"nevertheless 
"luckily 
some people knew it was supposed to be silly .
"for those of you who didn't 
"from the very beginning 
"i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick 
such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned .
first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up .
"meet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers "" ."
"four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces

( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) .
"right off the bat 
but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits .
"with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on 
"well sorry 
"that's right 
"with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) 
"what starship troopers really is 
"it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless 
it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery .
"if you deem this as sci-fi/action 
"it's sci-fi/action/comedy 
"gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film 
"yes 
"not since the old "" mr . bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch ."
people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated .
perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children .
"with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely 
"starship troopers has it's slow parts 
"aside from the intentionally cheesy gore 
"when the spaceship passes a meteor 
"if you're looking for brainless fun

i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me .
it didn't .
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them .
"but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is 
"it's a slightly more interesting angle

"there are some artificial settings

"even so

they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street .
"there might be some romantic interest 
no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular .

this is definitely not a film for everyone .

"lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra 
"the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police 
the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) .
"the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island 
"on the other hand 
"in the same time 
the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence .
"although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee 
"it is a real shame to see kelly 
"other actors 
"fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago

nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 )
a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson
"this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore ."
"inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name 
"the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment 
"until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video 
"both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length 
"apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent 
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one .
everyone knows the story of dracula .
or do they ?
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt .
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown .
upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her .
"locking harker up in his castle 
"upon divining his identity as a vampire 
"that is a story familiar to millions 
"nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film 
"the film's surreal 
"there is much to enjoy 
holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula .
"past screen portrayals 
"but kinski . . . oh boy 
"aided by a startling make-up job 
this man is dreadfully lonely .
"he lives in utter solitude 
kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting .
"when he dies 
"then there's the unforgettable soundtrack 
it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it .
"popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano 
when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums .
"the one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs ""

the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies .

"it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case 
"another more important similarity 
"this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie 
what helps final destination is its unique premise .
"unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders 
this being already has predestined when and how you will die .
"according to the brief history lesson given in this film 
"what is unique about death is that it's already dead 
the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ?
this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers .
"alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash 
alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off .

he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves .

this sets the tone for the rest of the movie .
"there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery

"lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship 
"they go to the movies 
"their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant

"synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair 
believe it .
sliding doors is a love 'what if' story .
the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions .
"in the beginning 
so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) .
"helen doesn't know it 
"the film shows what happens in both paths 
"in story one 
"arriving home early 
this leads to a life where helen moves out .
"helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart 
"in story two 
"she misses the train 
"in this new life 
will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ?
"opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans 
at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking .
sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year .
"not only is it a well-acted 
"when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker 
nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes .
"nobody scrambles around in danger 
"when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james 
and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) .
"instead he's a nervous and indecisive 
"another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital 
"in other words 
there are minor inconveniences .
"since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates 
"distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow 
"but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry 
"also 
"but these seem slightly forced 
possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ?

"at the age of 13

"director frank oz 
the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting .
edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today's standards .
he plays what is nearly a double role .
jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house .
one nice ( ? )
character i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold ) .
stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother's basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions .
he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon .
the film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist .
then the pace really picks up .
before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes .
though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown .
"on the subject of music

angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break .
she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does .
speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s .
it does the job .
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"the film follows a soft-spoken young man 
"as boogie nights opens 
"recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) 
"wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe 
"his lack of discipline 
"the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson 
"from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool 
"while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating 
"it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film 
"while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective 
"the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music 
"while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape 
"a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny 
"ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) 
it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters .
"after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film 
"larry flynt 
"however 
"the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate 
"if anything 
jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) .
"in both films 
rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false .
"in boogie nights and ed wood 
"much like the humour lacing ed wood 
mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter .
"while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging 
banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges .
"and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters 
"still 
"in any case 
"if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements 
there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights .
"mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here 
"similarly 
"boogie nights is exceedingly well cast 
"while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film 
"mr . reilly demonstrates here 
"i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot 
"mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number 
"worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track "" you got the touch "" in a vain attempt at a musical career ."
mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective .
"ms . graham 
"consequently 
her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity .
"( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face 
"and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen 
draw your own conclusions .
"perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle 
"his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness 
"while the scenario is familiar 
"luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way

price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . .
someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break .

"dunne doesn't believe him at first 
writer/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense .
how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ?
"for shyamalan 
"does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash 
"the answer to that question is not a very easy one 
"as far as pacing goes 
it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached .
"for unbreakable 
"the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent 
"there are tons of great shots in the film 
the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak .
"also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes 
several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film .
"one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers ."
"the music 
"if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year 
"the film also boasts some great performances 
"willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne 
"his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him 
"jackson is one of the better actors of our time 
"though his hairstyle is absurd 
"robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten 
"spencer treat clark 
"out of all the characters 
"where the film does lose points though 
"shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense 
when unbreakable revealed its own ending .
"it's not that the ending is bad 
"plus 
"essentially 
the only real problem is that the ending doesn't quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor .
"as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) 
"one thing seems clear 
shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film .

why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ?

"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities 
"however 
"one of them is close encounters of the third kind 
"unfortunately 
"although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects 
"when spielberg began work on that project 
"together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation 
"ironically 
"but in the mid 1970s 
"although very personal 
"spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology 
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot .
the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 .
"such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) 
"because of his obsession he loses his job 
"in the meantime 
"when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary 
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions .
two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there .
spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects .
"the slow 
"but 
"throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big 
"the last sequence 
one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism .
"aliens 
"it is very ironic 
spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public .
"but 
"there lies the main 
"the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally 
"despite such shortcomings 
"richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary 
"melinda dillon was

"the main difference 
"that main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) 
"the dude is unemployed 
"these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments 
"if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone 
"they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) ."
"the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck 
"unfortunately 
"soon 
"meanwhile 
"the plot 
"the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's "" run through the jungle 
"the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor 
"the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution ."
"there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski 
"the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! """
"shouts the big lebowski at one point ) 
"by the end

"in 1914 
28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years .

the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather .
it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men .
"with astonishing foresight 
"the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men 
"after the sinking of the ship 
considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world's harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself .
"( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary 
"if shackleton's original idea

"this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good 
"because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners 
"the final half tries to redeem this 
"the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on 
"we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life 
it only feels like half of that .
maybe even less .
"and it's not travolta 
"up to then 
"the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted 
"we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town 
and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is .
"facher is seen as an elderly man

"there was "" hollywood "" jack vincennes ( kevin spacey ) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid

"aliens ! ! well 
computer generated aliens .
"ok 
it's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib .
if one wasn't green and running around the other would not exist as it's known .
"the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular 
"since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien 
"well 
just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark .
along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way .
"j 
"k aims to recruit our poor j 
the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge .
that's also the main point of this movie : protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy .
some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty .
color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch .
the dialogue is witty to say the least .
this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie .
tommy lee jones ( as k ) and will smith ( as j ) provide both the action and the comedy beautifully .
the characters they play don't seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them .
"i would have to say that k is more amusing than j 
both roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors .
the story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless .
altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie .
a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor .
as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things .
the character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didn't need to be .
but if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie .

"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy 
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves .
"without an image projected onto the screen 
"even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie 
"but do cowboys really exist 
"exploring this theme 
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ?
"midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream 
"as joe buck migrates from place to place 
"during the opening credits 
"as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show 
"a troubled expression comes across joe's face 
"having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth 
joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream .
"he romanticizes about making it in the big city 
"by the end of midnight cowboy 
"just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen 
but how realistic are these ideals ?
joe had raped and been raped in texas .
"the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york 
alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation .
the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention .
schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny .
"we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy 
he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york .
"in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student 
"standing up 
"schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals 
"beyond the symbol of castration 
the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation .
"it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients 
joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . '
there are two predominant images of new york .
"the first is that new york is the rich 
"the other new york is travis bickle's new york 
"joe envisions new york as the former 
"mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine 
"joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york 
"the people steal joe's money 
what has become of joe's american dream ?
schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party .
"joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food 
"at the party 
"contrasting joe's daily struggles 
"there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular 
the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals .
joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils .
"the american dream 
"as joe heads to miami 
his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished .
"for joe 
"tossing his boots into the garbage 
"the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus 
"instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york 
reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice .
the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before .
the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream .
no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means .
midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream .
"there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians 
"then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock 
joe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york .
"during his search for an intangible paradise 
"an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream

"don't try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they do not like it 
underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today .
1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year .
we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them .
this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films .
"critics are calling it predictable and worthless 
"but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie 
"the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons 
her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted .
"after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat 
of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her .
however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money .
she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years .
"while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad 
"she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead 
which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it .
after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones .
he is a man who has had his share of bad things .
"while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband 
whatever happens the film was excellent to me .
i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great .
ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie .
"even if you know what is going to happen in the end 
"this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen 
"it could be one way or another 
the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made .
it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances .
the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years .
"even though a lot of critics didn't like the film 
"the director took his time making the movie 
i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability .
"it moved at a fast pace 
it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was .
"as fairy tales go 
"almost everyone knows it 
so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it .
it has been done before with varying results .
this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time .
"the basic story remains unchanged but 
there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature .
after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least .
.
"unlike in the fairy tale 
"the ? prince' 
although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . .
"the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france 
"this addition of leonardo da vinci 
for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired .
"for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle 
especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne .
"the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore 
although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable .
the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie .
as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique .
"but 
"the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella 
the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise .
"all in all this movie takes you back into history 
"but 
"so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not 
"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant 
"this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek 
"from this opening moment 
"although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek 
"while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults 
"the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider 
"the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad 
"their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on 
shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey .
"courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona 
"whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone 
"but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant 
"he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him 
"secondly 
"throughout this storyline 
"an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth 
"children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular 
"after the friendships and courage prevail 
"surprisingly 
"in this storyline 
"upon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her 
any child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance .
"on the technical side 
"directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner 
"these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) 
"myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other 
murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen .
"cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona 
"while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek 
schulman .
"the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer 
"capping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features 
"with shrek 
the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not .
"a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own 
"for a movie about disco-era excess 
"think of it as a sort of "" boogie nights "" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift 
"it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter

"he has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave 
"he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) 
"after rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell

""" 54 "" 's major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half 
"alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction

the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special .

"he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton 
"governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him 
"to help clean up the stanton campaign 
the acting throughout primary colors is superb .
it would be worth seeing the movie for bates' wild performance alone .
she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance .
"travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton 
emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run .
"the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other 
primary colors treads lightly on this issue .
"though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat 
"in fact 
"rather than issues 
"although the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory 
primary colors' chief problem is its length .
it runs about 15 minutes too long .
there are some scenes which could have easily been cut .

this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven .
he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers .

meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter .
someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after .
the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace .

detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film .
ocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals .
"most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over 
this film is pretty bizaare .
"it has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy 
"the plot of this movie is pretty large 
there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up .
the effects are still decent though .
"this sequel isn't more of the same really

"robocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire 
the japanese send a cyborg-ninja to deal with robocop .

this movie is easier to follow than the last one .

"from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment 
"to boot 
"at the core 
it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic .
it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship .
"at the end 
kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman .
"tom is completely convincing as dr . harford 
nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod .
"the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast 
eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander .

larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous .
"much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points 
"the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech 
larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea .
"larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff 
there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking .
"ultimately 
woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt .

"the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later 
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . .
and immediately tanked at the box office .
"whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined 
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters .
"a year later 
"prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country

"the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell 
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments .
the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is .
"the second feature is an audience participation track 
"most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off

"in the end 
"thailand's culture 
it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .
i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .
the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .
the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born .
"their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole 
"the prison authorities demanded good hygiene 
the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic .
"as for the thai justice system 
"'freedom' has many faces and "" brokedown palace "" explores many of them ."
"in the extreme 
some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .
but freedom seldom comes without a price .
"which is why the movie's other tag lines are : "" what is your dream ? """
"and "" how far would you go ? """
"i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom 
she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility .
i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .

"he declares himself reformed 
"among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) 
"carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) 
"old ways die hard 
carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film .
"in the first 
"both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem 
"yet for all the viscera 
"carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him 
"but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera 
"you sense that there's no way 
"indeed 
pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy .
"sean penn is even better 
"a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys 
"he could have been simply pathetic 
"he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink 
"as compelling as the narrative is 
"depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors 
"he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms 
"from a story standpoint 
"penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role

"star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans 
"after star trek v : the final frontier 
i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies .
"most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway 
"let me 
okay . let's move to the movie itself .
"star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise 
"this combination works well more often than it fails 
much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew .
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times .
star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld .
"forget the actors and special effects 
"this tranquility 
"it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth 
"the enterprise crew 
sound pretty heavy ?
"it is 
"when going after data

"the acting in star trek : insurrection is 
"since they've been playing these characters for years 
"the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech 
"brent spiner 
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good .
"despite many other critics' negative opinions 
"ru'afro reminds me 
"like the baron 
"in one particularly memorable scene 
ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations .

"the new enterprise itself

doc tells marty he must take his son's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) .
"whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn't joking 
"essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 
"at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better

"since when do things go according to plan in the "" back to the future "" movies ?"
there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won't even bother to list them all .
"basically we get to see marty as an old man 
the films' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle .
it's difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail .
the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense .
"instead of a grand finale 
"by the end everything is back to normal 
""" back to the future part ii "" is a really great adventure movie ."
it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor .

there is not one bad note in the acting .
it is affecting and layered and wonderful .
there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films .
then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene .
walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing .
"robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man 
director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote .
the problem is that he stays on them too long .
"julianne moore's character 
"after a few hours 
"quite a few scenes 
and just what is the theme ?
alienation ?
hopelessness ?
anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy .
"the film starts by showing three

"at times 
"other times 
anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film !
what's surprising is that it mostly works .
"if you have doubts about anderson's intentions 
"despite all the sturm und drang 
"despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur 
this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling .
my rating : a bulleye .

a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann .
her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful .

a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture .
the review
"if black & white 
"however 
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious .
"featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller 
"black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other 
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game .
"this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) 
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf .
"meanwhile 
"others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will 
mike tyson .
"the stories ebb and flow through the film 
"friendships are lost 
"originally rated nc-17 in the united states 
"while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating 
"the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for 
the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film .
"to toback's credit 
"these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns 
"whenever a character finds himself on donager's handheld digital camera 
"charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop 
"these youth know they are going through a phase 
toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny .
"most of the humour comes from mike tyson 
"he is given big words like vernacular to say 
but tyson also gets the film's scariest moment .
"as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry 
"the scene is entirely improvised 
"the reaction he gets 
"black & white is a film about hip-hop culture 
"but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does 
thus black & white's message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself .
toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way .
and we do .
"one year has passed since the last time we saw them 
"wayne's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend 
"they guys are just finishing off one of their shows 
"again 
"the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original 
"fortunately 
the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color .
"highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park 
"and if you've ever wondered why there's always boxes of watermelons 
this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more .
"garth has somewhat of a "" coming of age "" and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend 
"a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again 
"overall

john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad .
it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying .
james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie .
the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence .
the bad : no scares .
"yes that's right 
james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight .
"daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya 
"in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters 
"of course we all know sunshine kills vampires 
"after throwing a party for what happened 
"they kill almost all of jack's team 
"sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek 
she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek .
"they have to fight they're way against vampires 
'vampires' definately could have been done better .
"the make-up 
"it to me had more humor than horror 
john carpenter does a great job of directing this film .
"he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws 
"the script is clever and funny 
i much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions .
it's one of those films you see but don't take to heart .
you enjoy the time you spent and go on .
"the recently released 'psycho' is the same way 
'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer .
"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx 
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii .
"the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled 
availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng .
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small .
"although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed 
"to be fair 
"perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock 
"in fact 
"or 
"having said that 
surprised ?
"well 
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu .
"where he learned this style is uncertain 
"apparently 
"one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies 
"the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy 
"the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence 
"however 
the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners .
"in the beginning 
"in the process 
"after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies 
and so it goes .
"and the plot thickens later on 
let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the
action .
there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of
"course 
"however 
"the primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing 
"further 
there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor .
"under normal circumstances 
"the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper 
another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work .
"even without motor vehicles ( well 
"among other things 
( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . )
"unlike in american films 
"drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene 
"the performances are first-rate 
"the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious 
"jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years 
"as far as cinematography is concerned 
"it's nothing spectacular 
the picture is crisp and clear .
"one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that 
( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . )
it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release .
"drunken master ii shows the full potential of "" period piece "" kung fu movies 
"the plot does meander a bit 
"if you like this kind of movie

"as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home 
"they soon find out that they have much resistance 
"frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men 
"as the film begins to roll 
`special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie .
three kings is much smarter than that .
"as the conflict becomes more and more complex 
i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity .
this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant .
action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence .
"they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses 
not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) .
great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director .

"he also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution 
"hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit 
"stiles seems a bit stilted 
the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging .
"also desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) 
why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back .
it is irrational .
but these are minor carpings .
"overall 
"if nothing else 
"there is a scene early in soul food 
"during a wedding 
the way in which she does this makes me think irma p . hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now .
"however 
"vanessa williams 
"williams is teri 
"fox is maxine 
"long is bird 
her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving .
"at the center of everything is irma p . hall 
"every sunday 
"there is lots of conversation 
mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should .
"she is stern and disciplined 
"everything is going fine 
"all of a sudden 
"it gets so bad 
"without mama jo's guidance 
"miles and maxine's marriage begins to fall apart 
lem's temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him .
and teri tries to prevent maxine's efforts to sell mama jo's house .
the third act of the film deals with ahmad's attempts to patch things up .
"he decides to take over where mama jo left off 
"the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding 
hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy .
her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie .
brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future .
"he is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth 
tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up .
every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing ( except maybe an odd flashback sequence ) .
the dialogue is beleiveable and funny .
and then there's the food .
"tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food 
i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family .
soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year .
director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) .
"film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story 
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story .
"so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential 
"and when they add a fascinating story to it 
fincher's the game is no exception to this .
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time .
"fincher hasn't made a film since "" seven 
so it is about time he made another film .
and what a ride it is .
"the game isn't quite as powerful as "" seven 
"overall 
"it walks a line of insanity and reality 
"the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events 
"unfortunately 
"however 
the game is told completely from its main character's point of view .
nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman .
"he lives alone in his giant mansion 
"for his 48th birthday 
""" it will make your life fun again 
"as skeptical as nicholas is 
"seeing a billboard in an office 
"jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process 
""" each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs 
"one day 
"even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up 
what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun .
the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way .
how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive .
the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them .
"with "" seven 
he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to .
"compared to "" seven 
"because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness 
"so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game 
what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear .
"if taken as it is 
"but if you try and critique every minute detail 
perhaps that is the reason i docked the film .
"while trying to remain realistic and plausible 
we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable .
"the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously 
michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas .
"douglas has played lonely businessmen before 
"his character 
can he believe the waitress he bumped into ?
what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ?
"douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well 
"the supporting cast is essential in this film 
"sean penn is always good 
"deborah kara unger ( from "" crash "" ) is the waitress he bumps into 
"in fact 
"james rebhorn portrays his character very well 
"another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from "" shine "" ) as the book editor ."
"but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game 
"the game is rated r for language 
what is essential for this film to work is the writing .
"john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue 
this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects' did .
"however 
"and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen 
"originally launched in 1978 
"based on the mighty successful musical from broadway 
starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles .
plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia .
"the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song 
"critique : fun-loving 
"this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's 
"admittedly 
"but apart from the nostalgic vibe 
"this film took john travolta from a dim-witted "" sweathog "" on tv's welcome back kotter 
"unfortunately for the rest of the cast 
"on the down side 
am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) .
"make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player 
"and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards 
"little known facts : henry winkler 
both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture .
"conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest 
"set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie 
"christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman 
"it seems that bateman is a serial killer and 
"as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies 
i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school .
i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it .
"as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out 
"i picked it up and read it 
"the movie has a similar effect 
"for once 
both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout .
the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does .
"as a result 
lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference .
screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it .
"some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 
"thankfully 
"side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman's who 
the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian .
it's a subtle in-joke and it's one i found to be pretty humorous .
"despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) 
the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman .
whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters .
"i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman 
to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger .
"one sequence in particular 
"side note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film 
"huey lewis expressly requested that his song 
i'm assuming that collins requested the same .
"on a similar note 
"apparently 
a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film's release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film .
don't look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more .
several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i'm still undecided .
"there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops 
"the scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example 
"i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there 
"other than the few flaws i have mentioned 
i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such .
"it may not change anyone's life 
"i know i will certainly hear "" hip to be square "" in a different context the next time i hear it ."

ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ?
"you remember 
"always trying to help out the sweathogs 
""" so 
mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker .
that's right .
"i'm not sure if it's his main source of income 
"and there you were 
you silly goose .
"well 
"but rounders is about poker 
"sorry about the segue 
"matt damon plays mike mcdermott 
"he's been playing for a while 
"he goes to all the underground games in new york city 
"in the beginning of the film 
"mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) 
"mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker 
"months later 
"when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students 
"although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student 
"to make a film about gambling 
this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth .
"rounders 
the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all .
"there's a basement 
"except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city 
the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it .
"we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations 
"matt damon is very natural as mike 
"ed norton's worm is truly a worm 
"john turturro 
"he's both a friend and mentor to mike 
"martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors 
"while landau slips well into the role 
"perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent 
"she's a genuine peach to look at 
a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor .
"the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going 
one game in a cigar club had me in stitches .
""" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper 
i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys .

this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 .
"whether it was the meddling of studio executives 
the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up .
"someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed 
"now available on video 
the plot is thus .
we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) .
the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine .
"requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench 
"but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they're dealing with 
"meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and 
"this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig 
"the human drama is often riveting 
"the stunts 
and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established .
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss .
the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects .
"one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay 
"the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film's end 
"with the inclusion of these startling scenes 
why on earth were they left out of the original ?
this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible .
"so then 
"i say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain ."
"the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new 
"nonetheless 
"i have a soft spot in my heart for pure 
"i liked showgirls ( there 
"i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz 
wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen .

"wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors 
"i must admit up-front 
i imagine that this shows .
it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known .
"i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer 
"i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay 
"in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) 
"kelly's mother 
all of this happens fairly early in the film .
"and right up until this point 
"i was wrong 
"wild things isn't even remotely plausible 
i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers .
i'd give the preview four stars .
it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since .
"over the past few weeks though 
"the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film 
but i'm not here to talk about the preview .
i'm here to talk about denise richards .
"now 
"of course 
flawless body . . . but
"i thought she did a great job acting 
"no 
this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future .
"the other actors are good 
dillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) .
bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer .
"neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them 
"for a plot like this to work 
"that's okay 
"each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton 
"there isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage

"tarzan chad'z = good ) 1999 
"seen july 4 
"[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound 
"title : `tarzan' beautiful to look at 
review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story .
the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends .
"the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) 
"her mate 
"he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous 
i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this .
"later 
it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment .
"sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here 
there's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks .
it's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) .
"ultimately 
"and i mean that as a compliment 
"pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses 
"cons : surprisingly violent

"braveheart also employs humour at the right places

"now 
"sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations 
it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey .
as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory .
she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory .
"upon discovery 
the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power .
"let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness 
"the rapid succession of all those 8mm 
"also 
these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames .
some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) :
"mickey to mallory : "" one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you 
semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come .
at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet .
the two of course go hand in hand .
for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs .
"mickey during his marriage to mallory : "" as creator of my universe 
"the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting 
it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones .
"this is what mickey means by "" creator of my universe 
it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears .
scagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth .
"the indian sage releasing mallory's father 
"after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare 
this is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life .
then what were they killing up to that time ?
"in some case just those zombies faking their way through life 
"in other cases 
the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison .
it of course symbolizes rebirth .
"dr . emil reingold

"mickey : "" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . """
"mickey ( again in his interview ) : "" me and you

on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great .
"but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and

"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue 
"although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way 
"until that happens 
contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times .
"one of such movies 
"the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film 
"rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps

"like french connection 
"gerrald petievich 
"that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency 
secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times .
ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie .
"willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath 
"compared with him

this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will .
it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists .
"of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong 
insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films .
the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group .
in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction .
"it doesn't do a bad job 
"many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes 
the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense .
"there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet 
the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen .
"so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion 
"but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen 
"the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) 
"worf was on star trek : the next generation 
no problem so far .
"worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine 
"in the last star trek movie 
what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen .
"my minor problems with the movie aside 
"while many of the jokes do miss the mark 
the special effects are among the best for the star trek series .
the action is plentiful and well done .
this is a very good-looking movie .
it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate .
it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade .
they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster .
most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series .

james cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok .
for those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race .
human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed .
"however 
"to stop connor 
"in response 
images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film .
"even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 
"in the climax of star wars 
"in the terminator 
cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it .
unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse .
we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la .
children watch the flames in a burning television .
when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him .
"even though the "" future is not set 
all sara can do is await it .
( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 )

"while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for 
"cameron directs the film at a rapid

"the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom's heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator's )

"things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but 
"to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much 
"every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes 
"this aspect of the story 
"the coens might have done well to title the film "" fear and loathing in texas . """
"some have labeled "" blood simple as a modern-day noir 
"the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters 
"that said 
"the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards

"jacques tati's 1953 classic "" les vacances de m . hulot "" ( also known as "" mr . hulot's vacation 
"the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly 
yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory .
part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags .
"slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy 
"in "" les vacances de m . hulot 
"in one sequence 
"while crossing over to get the can 
"when he actually takes the boat out into the water 
tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film .
"it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations 
tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement .
"when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume 
"tati also uses running gags to this effect 
"for example 
"then this image turns up again in the finale 
"the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average 
"as much as i was laughing during this film 
the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters .
"it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively

u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets .
"this may be true 
"set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats 
there's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 .
"it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors

"once the crew gets on the u-boat 
"as soon as the action starts 
"this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises 
the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations .

"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person 
"( since 1984 
"in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) 
"a girl's parents hear sighing 
"mulan bravely runs away 
"ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later 
"the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government 
mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman .
"the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story 
"in disney's mulan 
old mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) .
"fearing for her father's life 
"meanwhile mushu 
( his only duty is to ring a gong . )
mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero .
"with the help of mushu 
opinion : east meets west .
i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors .
"from their state of the art animation studio in orlando 
"i mean 
yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic .
the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever .
"personally 
mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney .
"kids of any age will like the family themes 
"and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor 
"and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family 
but even the tiniest details reveal quality .
"the movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces 
"computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 
and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game .
balance is crucial .
"a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea 
the dream team .
"by the same token 
"it's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west 
"it's movie for any age 
"if you've ever perused my college comedy diary "" another year in the life of a nerd "" ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) 
"in fact 
"so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates 
then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk .
scratch that idea .
but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal .
"of course 
"even without the college element 
i'm glad i did .
peter falk's performance was actually what made the movie .
"and this is a guy i never considered a real actor 
"falk pleasantly surprised me here 
"falk plays rocky 
the movie begins with the mom's death and the son moving in with his grandparents .
"after a couple stops along the son's journey to manhood 
"the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place 
"the movie spans nine more years of rocky's relationship with his grandson 
"so 
or am i confusing movie plots again ?
"roommates has an almost epic feel to it 
"death 
roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween .
"the number can't be counted on one hand 
"and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie ( no 
i won't come out and say it .
"instead 
roommates plays on all the major emotions .
it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry .
"movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience 
my point ?
there are no absolutes .
"or 
"either way 
capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen .
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse .
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet .
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style .
"
perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? )
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa .
"his films all seem to have one style 
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold .
"little known in the us to date 
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid .
"his 1998 film cure 
cure is probably his classic .
"last year he released seance 
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story .
pulse is kurosawa back on form .
"taguchi 
two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment .
"taguchi 
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain .
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself .
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall .
taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus .
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide .
but they are not entirely dead .
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet .
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost .
"if they say yes 
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist .
"this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing "" like a computer disk . """
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses .
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers .
leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death .
this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work .
"it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death 
"kurosawa 
frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact .
his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange .
"junichiro hayashi 
images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain .
scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might .
people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence .
seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary .
"kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock 
"of any horror filmmaker in the world 
i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .
"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan 
"i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry

"and see it you should ; the animation is

"in fact 
could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ?
the casting is fairly good .
"tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief 
"nicely done ) 
"lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice 
minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane .
"i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) 
i take back my insult on driver .
"it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic 
"on the villiany side of the voices

"she says 
"i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments

"in his most recent movie 
"he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name 
"playing the title role 
"this con man is very likeable for some reason 
"maybe the message is that 
bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars .
"martin 
the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain .
"in order to attract actors and crew members 
the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it .
but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger .
he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him .
he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage .
will bowfinger be able to make his film ?
or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ?
bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line .
the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department .
"this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about 
"besides the very repetitive and superflous ending 
if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it .
"if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures 
"whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films 
"the latest movie morass from hollywood 
the scary thing is that it's actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month .
the crew works for several reasons .
"the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie 
"the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their "" golden paradise "" by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property ."
"the four mobsters 
"this "" simple plan "" suddenly goes screwy 
the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men .
"instead of concentrating on bobby's search for his daughter 
"the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya 
a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs .
"the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner 
"the quick script written by barry fanaro 
the crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can get these days .
"the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids 
"in the steady flow of "" extreme "" comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main 
"along his carreer 
"for all that 
"the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace 
"accepting so huge challenge 
"it was 
"braveheart is

"the william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value 
"seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression 
as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up .
"his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone 
"however 
"braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty 
mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast .
"patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i 
the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good .
"sophie marceau 
"i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen 
"however 
the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is .
"when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes 
"braveheart is 
i've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean .
"for now 
it won't be easy !
it's gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson .
"renown surrealist director 
the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts .
"he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct 
the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage .
"it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person 
"what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters 
"yet it is not without its striking moments and charms 
"also 
it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there .
it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness .
"they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) 
she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) .
"she once went out with a businessman 
"simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat 
"simon's boss is the much younger 
screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts .
jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d .
"in history 
"she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks 
"on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon 
"to his dismay 
"bacri as the classy nicolas 
"he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors 
"odile still pines for him 
"love is 'the same old song' that makes the world go 'round 
"everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place 
"there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical 
"this film is not one his great ones 
it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice .
it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love .
"in 1987 the stock market crashed 
"wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had 
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange .
"critics and audiences lauded wall street 
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them .
"i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures 
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) .
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions .
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane .
"it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity 
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top .
"these guys are salesmen after all 
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street .
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date .
"and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties 
"in my mind 
maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace .
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap .
"they both feature a consequential father-son relationship 
"and they are both concerned with the power of greed 
"boiler room is a message movie as well 
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash .
"as i said 
"in our super-judgmental 
"and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way ."
he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him .
"ben affleck is cast as jim 
his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood .
it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers .
"affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross 
"affleck shouts 
"when alec played the scene he became the part 
by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading .
the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game .
rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters .
they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes .
"we drink up this world along with seth 
"as in all cautionary tales 
i know this story .
we all do .
"but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy 
as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn .
his style is sitcom bland .
but his writing isn't .
younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet .
despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script .
"the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection 
these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one .
"with the exception of affleck's brief appearances 
"ribisi 
"he conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way ) in some scenes 
"the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone 
boiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys .
"those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) 
diesl shines in his minor role .
this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner .
"in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80's 
nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have .
"nia long 
the two make an oddly likeable couple .
"long is smart and brash 
"at one point he says to her "" i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love "" ."
"it's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way 
"unfortunately 
"there is much crying 
"this is okay when taken in small doses 
a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims .
"it's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking 
"that message being 
"yes it's patently obvious 
and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners .
boiler room offers neither extreme .
"it gives us what is in between 
look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future .
"some sort of decision had to be made 
">from time-to-time 
"perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train 
"maybe that's where you met your significant other 
"film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else 
"the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski 
"these themes weave their way through many of his movies 
"however 
"in his autobiography 
"while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including 
"the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device

the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant .
"there is no sadness

"j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an "" oldies "" tv station ? or is it ?"
i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed .
i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office .
"but it wasn't until months later 
"it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some "" healthy "" immorality is not a world at all ."
"instead 
"there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made 
"now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted 
"besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews

"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement ."
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident .
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before .
"in style 
"van peebles 
"because no studio would dare fund such a film 
"the movie ended up costing about $500 
van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself .
"he wrote the script 
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck .
"for instance 
he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling .
"the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple ."
"it takes place in los angeles 
"one day 
"however 
"acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation 
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico .
"although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film 
van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored .
"at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback 
"van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality 
"of course 
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made .
"at that time 
"distributors were petrified of a film that 
"of course 
""" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era 
""" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers ."
"however 
"when it was first released 
there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of .
"others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations 
"still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex 
"nevertheless 
"it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance 
"until that point 
"the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks 
"van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it ."

"the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn 
"missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity 
""" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter 
""" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes 
"this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife 
"but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's 
""" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film 
"hoggett's love for babe 
"best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe 
"it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) 
"please understand 
"but having said that 
"as an overall piece 
"sure 
"it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor 
""" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best 
"as a result 
let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal .
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal .
i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times .
"under no circumstances 
"this theater 
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age .
"in other words 
"as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater 
i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together .
"there 
"which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular 
my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix .
it is nothing short of stunning visually .
"sadly 
"the matrix has at it's core a good concept 
keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax .
it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster .
"now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator 
the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed .
the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose .
that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons .
they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie .
"reeve's character 
"newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors 
the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular .
this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts .
this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film .
"when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world 
"as i already said 
"acting in the matrix is not bad 
keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances .
"although to his credit 
laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film .
more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama .
joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had .
carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role .
it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks .
you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film .
it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences .
"i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue 
in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird .
it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie .
so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about .
thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability .
my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending .
the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before .
the ending itself was just plain strange .
the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch .
"while the rest of the film ( acting 
alchemy is steeped in shades of blue .
"kieslowski's blue 
"with its examination of death 
"language aside 
"as a result 
"alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" 
"while there are common themes and story elements running through all three 
"when the film opens 
"following his sudden death in an automobile accident 
"events swirls around her 
"in her quest to make sense out of her loss 
alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues .
"in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one 
does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ?
"are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life 
"myers' challenge is to make these subjects 
"through louisa's struggles 
"while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing 
"even when we're not connecting with louisa 
the cinematography is stunning .
"city scenes are tinted with blue 
"later 
it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability .
"the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul ."
"and 
her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal .
"even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character 
"alchemy isn't pure magic 
who would have thought ?
jim carrey does drama .
"when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show 
"however 
the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man .
that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) .
"truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly 
"christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world ."
he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles .
"there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world 
the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world .
"we see what he is doing at his current age 
"it may seem a tad boring 
the film can be described in one word : weird .
"it seems like such a simple idea 
"it seems like a warped idea 
jim carrey actually lived up to the hype .
"the hype 
"no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be 
and he showed them all up .
jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .
"i do not think he was the best actor 
"he plays truman burbank 
"he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years 
he ventures into the wrong elevator .
a light crashes in front of him .
his father comes back and is then pulled away .
"we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show 
and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish .
carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama .
laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife .
she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point .
"peter weir does not make the cast perfect 
the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down .
"despite carrey's greatness 
"he displays the pressure he is under 
he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life .
"the action moves at a good pace 
"but 
it really makes you think .
"maybe your brother is an actor 
some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking .
or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival .
and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line .
all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative .
"i was not only enjoying the film 
"overall 
"jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces 
andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .
the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .
"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii 
to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity .
the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste .
"
more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way .
this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law .
"during world war ii 
this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal .
"when the japanese had captured prisoners 
minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output .
"while the germans 
the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad .
that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do .
the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day .
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll .
in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany .
"filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story 
there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps .
certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai .
there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it .
"then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . """
lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa .
it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university .
the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them .
the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad .
"it turns out to be a grim joke 
beating and torture are commonplace events .
men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable .
"however 
so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine .
this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies .
"the japanese believe that the individual is nothing 
conformity is purpose .
before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp .
if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story .
"if the british ( with one american 
it is neither .
it is a stirring and believable account of camp life .
the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow .
this serves a double purpose for cunningham .
it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat .
it also creates a distancing effect .
the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music .
this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience .
i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .
"another 'independent film' 
"favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park 
"the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve 
and all of this is great fun .
"swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects 
"no 
"the script 
"mike is always missing is girlfriend 
"the audience feels for this pathetic little man 
"vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent 
"some of his chat-up lines are awful 
"vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film 
"the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great 
"there are some excellent 
"embarrassing to him 
"mike & trents friends are also good 
"although this is primarily mike and trents film 
they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background .
"but again 
it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles .
the acting is superb .
"as said above 
"favreau is also good 
"graham ( boogie nights 
"she hardly features in the film at all 
"swingers 
"firstly 
"the film comes to an abrupt halt 
"it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion 
"also 
"but these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny 
a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal .
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another .
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain .
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end .
"if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy 
"it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) 
edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states .
you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines .
"arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad 
"however 
"in retaliation 
"unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) 
"while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple 
"generally 
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country .
"hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory 
"the original tagline for patriot games was 
"however true 
"revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states 
"admittedly 
i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order .
"it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population 
"in fact 
"although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign 
"throughout 
"what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act 
"it actually gets rather heady at times 
"i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else 
"this 
"annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently 
"it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point 
"bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role 
"however 
"notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad 
"the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage 
"difficult to say the least 
"perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings 
"whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) 
"i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music 
revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole .
it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year .
missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes .
"for example 
"unfortunately 
"in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) 
verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point .
"the film also gets a little preachy toward the end 
"a noble gesture 
"these flaws are glaring 
very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) .
they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind .
"you may have seen them on their television program 
"in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut 
"beavis & butt-head ( yes 
they live their lives in front of the television .
the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen .
"this happens as they sleep 
"beavis even tries to use the remote 
the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television .
even at this point they have no idea what has happened .
"they look around 
"before the movie i knew that they were stupid 
this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film .
"eventually they realise that their television has been stolen 
luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife .
"this man 
"beavis & butt-head 
"they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her "" ."
"to them 
"not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) 
"inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime 
"oddly enough 
"they end up travelling right across america 
"the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations 
at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself .
beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives .
they even get to meet the president .
"but all they care about is getting their television back 
"this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are 
"the humour is certainly crude 
"in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them 
"in this respect 
"if you are easily offended 
"otherwise 
one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you'll
never hear the end of it !
"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film 
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years .
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film .
"by that point 
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience .
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts .
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in .
"i guess they can be excused though 
"anyway 
"i think the most noticeable aspect of this 
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined .
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series .
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series .
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 .
"for the most part 
"although 
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted .
"while he did a good job for the most part 
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie .
he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing .
but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing .
"if you have ever seen a bond film 
the world is not enough is no exception .
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world .
"007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) 
why this point is included is beyond me .
"they took great pains to explain his condition 
"anyway 
i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore .
"bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner 
"along the way 
"like all bond films 
my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films .
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing .
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character .
it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film .
"later 
"but because it is a bond film 
"after all 
how about the cast ?
brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 .
"i grew up with the roger moore version of bond 
"judi dench 
she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner .
"robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye 
"coltrane gets more screen time 
then there are the bond girls .
sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today .
there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim .
those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face .
marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest .
then we have denise richards .
there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks .
"and after you see the outfits she wears 
i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist .
"admittedly 
i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character .
"while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had 
"the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character 
"i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character 
"this might have worked well in another movie 
"last 
"although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films 
rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role .
he says future appearances are up to a higher power .
"the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement 
"while we don't see much of him in this film 
so how does it stack up ?
"despite some problems 
"and 
this is easily the best of the brosnan films .
"it may even be the best of the entire series 
"one thing is for sure 
here's looking forward to bond number 20 .

"modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before 
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it .
""" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends ."
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story .
"firstly 
"everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves 
"but to just state this is arbitrary 
"labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat 
"for the sake of this review 
another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus .
"we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home 
"the film is a complete character study with the tight 
"no one plot dominates the story

"the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do 
"first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) 
"barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife 
"mary is a writer of some sort 
"labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals 
"obviously 
"another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time 
their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship .
"if only one aspect of the film could use improvement 
"it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other 
what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ?
"labute never really answers 
"two other characters act as catalysts 
"cary is an arrogant 
"somehow he is able to bend women to his will 
"he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted 
"patric gives an outstanding performance 
cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her .
"she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film 
"she's a sweet woman

"the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios 
"the result is sometimes surprising

"since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references 
"are we to assume that these people are

3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart .
4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 .
5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic .
"6 . the reunion has to bring them together 
7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited .
"8 . eightly 
9 . there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years .
"10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts

"the two performers work perfectly together 
"of course 
"stoppard 
the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet .
"one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie 
director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director .
i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed .
"in fact 
"stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film 
"there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself )

seven's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does .

it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances .
"the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions 
and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution .
"a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) 
"as a test 
their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness .
the first third of a . i .

circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons .
he is abandoned and alone .

"the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy 
"during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law )

"these scenes seem almost superfluous

here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park .
"in 1993 
"now 
"once again 
"now 
that film is amistad .
"although not as masterful as schindler's list 
"thematically rich 
"watching schindler's list was a powerful 
"spielberg pulled us into the narrative 
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since .
"amistad 
"the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books 
"however 
"several 
"on the whole 
"one stormy night during the summer of 1839 
"led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) 
"adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa 
"they are tricked 
"the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison 
the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) .
"they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) 
"aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) 
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause .
"current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) 
"at its heart 
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to .
"he is a free man 
"effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou 
"they are individuals 
"to amplify this point 
"the larger struggle is 
"as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human 
"the abolitionists regard the africans as men 
"in a sense 
"amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating 
"four claimants come forward against the africans : the state 
"baldwin must counter all of these claims 
"even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier 
"aside from cinque 
"matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin 
"likewise 
"nigel hawthorne 
"finally 
"hopkins 
his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable .
one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain .
"schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth 
there is no such figure in amistad .
"the villain is slavery 
it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist .
"amistad's trek to the screen 
"an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 
numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves .
"it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has 
you know you're in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question's most normal character .
"such is the case with "" the big lebowski 
"there's no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment 
"thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor 
"the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) 
"one night 
"once the dude realizes this coincidence 
"soon 
it seems bunny's troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn .
"the dude 
"chaos obviously ensues 
""" the big lebowski "" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that "" fargo "" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film 
"the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over 
"the coens ( joel directed 
"whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence 
"there are those who will dislike this film 
the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given .
"bridges exudes a likeable 
"goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration

"i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled 
"that 
"i knew this fact only five minutes into the film 
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick .
seriously .
"i've never been a big john travolta fan 
make that 'roles' in the movie .
"even travolta's great performance 
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout .
"half drugged out of his mind 
now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not .
that's what really makes this movie unique .
it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all .
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's
the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and
never hit .
several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again .
the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant .
"whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies 
"joan allen 
i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it
would have wrecked her potrayal .
gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends .
other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a

"after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - "" geez 
"there were certain bits that weren't handled properly 
"overall 
but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect .
many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i
certainly hope so .
"those print and television ads trumpeting that "" 'grease' is still the word "" are right on the money ."

"or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- "" empty nest "" dinah manhoff ) ?"
and these are all probably considered minor moments . . .
"a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson 
"for those eight of you who aren't familiar with the story 
"sandy tries to rekindle their relationship

"the drag race finale is yet something of a drag 
"the movie's first showpiece is "" summer nights 
"not only is "" nights "" tremendously catchy 
"there has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of "" you're the one that i want "" and "" we go together 
"all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller 
"the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of "" nights "" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography

"the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you 
"the film takes place 
"hrundi v . bakshi 
"hrundi tries out his acting talents 
"on the set of his current film that he stars in 
"during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's 
"this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes 
many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever .
and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j .
"edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood 
clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood .
"but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party 
"of course 
"each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation 
"and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter 
"the party can be compared to many other films of it's type 
"it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say "" birdy num-num "" ? ) ."

what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution .
"i mean 
"as was the case with the meteor movies 
"in fact 
but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison .
"a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right 
"in fact 
i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months .
"it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy 
"the ants spend all season putting together the offering 
"just before the grasshoppers come 
"flick 
"he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) 
"flick doesn't know they're actors 
the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation .
"created by pixar 
"the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space 
"this is a lush 
"the film is also mercilessly exciting 
but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters .
"flick 
"but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) 
"all of these bugs have more than a token personality 
"in my review of antz 
"in concept 
"with such strong work in both animation and script 
"it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie 
"after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies

"coincidentally 
"you know disney

"she'll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her 
"and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple 
"it's a simplistic plot

"as much as anything 
"in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter

with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational .

the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger .

scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well .
"during a film-class discussion 
"a few rare exceptions are noted 
.
.
scream 2 !
1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america !
"a sequel was unavoidable 
"in fact 
"sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) 
"meanwhile 
"as scream 2 opens 
"this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown "" copycat "" sets out to repeat what's been done ."
.
.
and finish what hasn't !
"of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film 
"this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script 
"as much as the film condemns the use of cliches 
"i will note 
"did wind up being the first person i suspected 
all the actors outdo themselves here .
"we're not talking oscar performances 
"the characters remain true to their roots 
"we can see how the events in the first film has affected them 
the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor .
"it's a natural 
"we skip two years 
"it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters 
than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces .
"while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels 
"as i said before 
the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first .
"this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique 
"if ever a film followed it's original so well 
"scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream 
"it would top off the series quite well 
"it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years 
"like they say 
.
.
"but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed 
"devotees of robert a . heinlein 
"the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless 
"and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers 
"heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement 
"outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor 
"sometime in the future 
"among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) 
"while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence 
"so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens 
"for one thing 
"the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate 
"if starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie 
"it's a story which requires emoting 
the no-name cast also plays into verhoeven's treatment of heinlein's most controversial conceit .
"in this society 
"verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service 
"these characters really are just "" fresh meat for the grinder 
"it's not that starship troopers is anti-military 
"in fact 
verhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he's making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects .
"if that makes starship troopers hypocritical 
"there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film 
"verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences 
it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn't perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings .
"i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers 
that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material .
"no 
"event = horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film

"this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour

"it was 1971 
johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop .
"during the filming 
"i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much 
the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo .
"i couldn't believe that this fat 
"word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role 
"plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin

"and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie

taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) .
"one day 
"an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron 
"taran leads hen wen into the forest 
"along the way 
"when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away 
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away .

"there 
"along the way 
"the three manage to escape the horned king's castle 
"as they rest in the forest 
"he leads taran 
"suddenly 
"taran is reunited with hen wen 
"he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron 
"with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli 
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place .
"when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron 
"taran agrees 
"but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed 
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive .
"things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran 
"taran 
"just when all seems lost 
"taran is about to jump into the black cauldron 
"gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron 
"taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi 
"he kicks the horned king away 
"taran 
"the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away

the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group .

"before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions 
bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream .
"miller 
"when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio 
"by this time 
many of the studio's old men had retired or died .
"therefore 
"originally budgeted at $25 million 
"the film was rated pg and the film 
"in addition 
"but whatever the real reason 
"the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department 
"the next two disney animated features 
only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features .
"as for the black cauldron 
"finally 
"because of all this 
the people who had seen the film didn't think so .
"in fact 
"for a while 
"few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) 
"but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors 
"somewhere online 
"before that time 
those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version .
"even still 
"some felt that it was indeed cut 
"but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable 
"as for myself 
"in fact 
"much to my surprise 
the one that flopped at the box office ?
"the one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ?"
this doesn't seem like all of the above .
"instead 
the film has a wonderful cast of characters .
"there's taran ( grant bardsley ) 
"the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all 
"he is brave 
there's a likeable character here !
not that he's the only likeable character in the film .
"there's gurgi ( john biner ) 
"but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman 
"the other characters 
"the story itself is an adventurous one 
"elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly 
the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios .
"even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good 
overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor .
"fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one 
"there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) 
fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie .
"even though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film 
that better chance has finally come .
"whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared 
"i can't help but think though 
"quiz show 
"on this trivial game show 
the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win .
"but 
"quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants 
"stempel ( john turturro ) 
and your jewish man raising a family .
"stempel has been the reigning champion on "" twenty-one "" for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars ."
"in his mind 
"although

"quiz show is an extremely well done movie 
"the performances turned in by john turturro 
quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film .
definitely a film you should not miss .
is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all-time ?
it's quite possible .
"his career spanned over 40 years 
"yet 
and that's really a shame .
""" the naked spur "" features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him ."
"it's a western 
"before he finds that man 
"when the criminal is eventually caught 
the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly .
"also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal 
we're never too sure who's side she's really on until the end .
"leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the "" shower lady "" from "" psycho "" 
she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men .
stewart gives a performance unlike anything i've ever seen from him .
"he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs 
"i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a "" nice guy "" ."
"his performance borders on psychotic at times 
it's roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do .
"he was an actor unafraid to take chances 
"every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget 
"such is the case with ? good will hunting ? 
"despite some serious character problems 
you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick .
"will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t .

"he ? s good-looking

in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love .
the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film .
"even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood 
"alas though 
the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character .
is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ?
of course .
"is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep 
"usually 
"but 
not very likely .
"come on 
girls .
"will is just a little too perfect 
"the heavy-handed 
"all this sounds pretty bad 
"damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable 
which leads me to the really good part of the review .
the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting .
i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom .
"from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend 
robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line .

in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us .

"suddenly 
"where "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is 
"there is a big difference 
"it shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house 
"the cast 
costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family .
this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know .
"kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe 
"the meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture 
this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels .

i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture .
"i still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies ."
"and i think that "" 12 angry men "" 
"but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents ."
the film is set in burma in 1943 .
a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .
"but the british commanding officer 
"struggling toughly 
afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .
"he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale 
"but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge 
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .
"and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" ."
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito .
"in this regard it is symptomatic that shears 
the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men .
( the plot by-passes these risks . )
"that means 
but it has a lot of virtues as well .
""" the bridge on the river kwai "" shows the "" madness "" of war and what it can produce in people's minds ."
it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .
and lean's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests .
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .
david lean's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect .
"his film is highly suspenseful 
the film is also well-photographed and has an apt score .
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .
the other actors deliver fine performances as well .
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping .
the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch's story telling so amazing .
"maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship 
"through these multiple stories 
lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion .
instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times .
lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine .
"however 
"it is very hard to discuss "" blue velvet "" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper's sadistic frank ."
most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable .
"kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role 
laura dern was consistently annoying .
but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in .
his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask .
frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon .
many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy .
"just like his villain in "" speed "" 
"this harshness is exactly what frank is 
""" blue velvet "" has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again ."
for this sole reason it is recommended .
but also see it to admire lynch's obsession to avoid the norm .

he wants frank back .
"and a small matter of some ? 25 
for this he won't break anyone's thumbs .

"the film is in many ways reminiscent of another "" little "" independent feature 
"that film 
"witness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed 
"that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in "" highway 61 . """
"what's also charming about "" i went down "" is how the relationship between buddy and git develops ."
"their trip becomes an education for both of them 
"the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation 
"it's a little too hollywood

"although "" i went down "" emphasizes the comedic elements of dis-organized crime

"satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything 
""" dr ."
"strangelove "" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e ."
""" men in black "" ) ."
"what's unique about "" wag the dog "" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions 
"the result is a clever comedy based on an original 
if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness .
"in this age of information and technology 
"we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news 
"this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas 
"that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) 
"brean 
"they pitch him an idea to "" produce "" the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it ) ."
soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play .
"we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation 
"the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv 
"the characters' dialogue is witty and funny 
"for example 
"motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry 
"since it's all computer-enhanced anyway 
this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise .
"but then there's the gags and one-liners that 
"by the time the film makes it to the midpoint 
"the first act is quickly paced 
"every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with 
the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners .
"however 
as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture .
"what had started off as a brilliant 
"still 
willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted .
"truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time 
"however 
"then again 
"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project 
this new film has been underrated for no reason .
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films .
"it is also more psychological 
"the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters ."
"the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score 
"more than all money and power on earth 
"the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate ."

.
visually this film is as spectacular as the first two .
"gordon willis' rich cinematography 
"but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep 
the third installment has only the plot and visuals .
"some characters could be much more developed and the acting 
"the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla 
"the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino 
"andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son 
violence is natural to him .
"he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf 
however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless .
and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed .
"the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends 
"in the third film michael has become almost like his father 
this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed .
"many have pointed out that making the third film 
i disagree .
"it is a beautiful film of great importance 
the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life .
it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times .
"a man desperately trying to keep his balance 
the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life .
the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed .
there is no turning back .
"and no matter how hard you try to get out of it

"driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small 
"it's a quiet film 
"but if you're patient with it 
"driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name 
"the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago 
"uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper 
"the film 
"the movie relies on character 
"in fact 
"rather 
"the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history 
the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway .
"the insurance company cancels her insurance 
"freeman 
the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger .
"driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature 
"daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways 
"initially 
"once she does get in the car 
"to make matters worse 
"eventually 
"tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well 
"we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations 
"nevertheless 
"freeman 
there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color .
"hoke is uneducated and illiterate 
"both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element 
they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves .
they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor .
"at the same time 
"in his first dramatic role 
"drama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor 
"the only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper 
"under the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart 
"but fortunately 
"in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen 
uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say .
beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film's dramatic moments .
"the movie tugs at your heart 
the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees .
"when people are talking about good old times 
nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s .
"for new generations 
"for people who actually had to live in that period 
feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era .
"martin scorsese's taxi driver 
"the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) 
"the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis 
"the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) 
their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre .
"losing his only link to better side of the world 
he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict .
"that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) 
"as many great movies that got cult status through the years 
"for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty 
"for others 
brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .
"his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation 
"his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him 
"however 
"but despite anything 
"while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places 
"wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he "" knows stuff "" ."
his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .

""" what does it take to play carnegie hall ?"
"practice . """
"it takes two hours for music of the heart to "" play carnegie hall 
"like the children it portrays 
"roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids 
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school .
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors .
that is the pattern-like plot of this production .
"ultimately 
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful .
roberta's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat .
"also lacking depth is the film's "" bad guy 
the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre .
"they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because "" my mom said . . . "" ) and a glowing concert ."
"not knowing the running time 
but they don't .
instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent .
"director wes craven 
"one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic "" but . . ."
"last night . . . """
and roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father's absence .
the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie .
roberta's mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype .
the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta's students is gunned down and killed off screen .
one thing the film does lack is subtlety .
"the fact that a little boy was playing "" we shall overcome "" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference ."
the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience .
"( of course 
"even with all its flaws 
that is not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning .
"but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall 
in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history .
"the performance included a dead-on elvis impression

he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience .

"everyone has their own life story 
"that seems to be the basic theory behind `go 
"in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them 
"these types of characters might not sound all that original 
how they will all come together is the process the film deals with .
i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general .
"the film starts out as anything else 
"we meet ronna ( polley ) 
"she's not very charming 
"maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character 
"things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy 
this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug .
the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death .
"nearly the same can be said for two other characters 
once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle .
"when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene 
"considering how good it is up until that point 
"and so the film begins to take shape 
"the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story 
simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined .
"the third arc 
we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna .
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were .
"i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end 
"perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability 
"still 
"? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman 
"he doesn't just depict a story 
"? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general

"and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue 
"yet 
"the sheer 
the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives .
and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around .
"there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns 
"jackie brown's lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives ."
"this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before 
"however 
"had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages 
"as a result 
"for the second picture in a row 
"this time around 
"in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career 
there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) .
"grier is jackie brown 
"she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) 
"no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie 
"jackie passes ordell's test 
"soon 
"unsurprisingly 
"in addition to looking fantastic 
robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles .
"bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini 
"robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking 
"the film 
"tarantino keeps things moving along nicely 
"when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) 
"it's an entertaining diversion 
one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable .
"you know 
"sure 
"this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused 
"one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is 
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls .
"there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie 
"however 
"well 
"unfortunately 
"that may give the actor credit for the role 
"however 
"plotwise 
"we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) 
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself .
"obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun 
"at his house 
"this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer 
"however 
before she is abducted .

"because of these character-developing scenes 
"after being abducted 
"remembering that the killer gave her certain rules 
"when casanova comes to punish her 
"after she is found 
"from this moment on 
"many people will compare this film to 1995's seven 
"the screenplay 
what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness .
"the cinematography 
sometimes a simple shot is the best one .
"however 
"the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done 
"the camera work is terrific 
"the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness 
"however 
morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors .
"detective cross is a very good character for him 
"because of freeman's powerful presence 
"the other half is carried by ashley judd 
"in fact 
"her character is more original than freeman's 
we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream .
"the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped 
"cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina 
"tony goldwyn fairs slightly better 
"gina ravera gives a good performance 
"so as a result of all these small supporting parts 
"some of the best acting of this genre 
two other essential aspects of the film are quite good .
"director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors 
"he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have 
"however 
part of the blame falls on david klass .
"i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more 
"while this may give the two leads more screentime 
"thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel 
"none of the conversations are laughable 
one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer .
"i blame this mainly on the casting director 
"kiss the girls is rated r for terror 
"with all the implausibilities of this film 
"in fact 
"the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone 
this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through .
"morgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor 
i must also say that i loved the ending .
"the showdown between good and evil was quite tense 
"perhaps it may not be possible 
i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars .
"from my first viewing 
"from my second viewing however 
"the spanish prisoner

"also like the aforementioned films 
mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games .
"like his past gem 
"because we were deceived just like the victim 
"mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped 
"the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over 
the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued .
"after seeing the film again 
"his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them 
"the story follows a young up and coming businessman 
"soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his "" process . """
"through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell 
"played by steve martin 
"the most interesting character in the film 
the character's transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable .
"david mamet's script is so interesting because we know people don't actually talk like the characters in the film 
his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge .
"this is a must see 
"an unhappy italian housewife 
"the story concerns the aforementioned housewife 
"instead of waiting for a ride home 
"upon arriving 
"of course 
"in what seems like days 
"rosalba 
i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .
"but maglietta and ganz 
"ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn 
"throughout the movie 
the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .
director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .
"the cheap mimmo 
the reason ?
mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .
"the novice detective's various misfortunes 
"unfortunately 
"rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice 
it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .
"several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure 
"early in the movie 
"after that 
it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any .
but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .
"the movie is fun and romantic 
or if our passports weren't missing .
"after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction 
it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language .
"luckily 
"the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) 
she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary .
"but one day 
"jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) 
"soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 
"also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) 
"the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown 
"it's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there 
"there are 
"the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda 
the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie .
a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ?
you've got to commend the acting .
jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting .
"the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours 
"tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily 
"also 
"jackie brown has four major shootings 
"you can expect frequent foul language 
the acting is the glue that holds everything together .
"grier 
"in fact 
"another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster 
"michael keaton makes his presence felt 
"speaking of that 
there's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie .
which is a life-saver for mr . tarantino .
"the story barely holds together in the meantime 
but oh well .
"jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino

"there is very little background given to the viewer 
"squabbles take place one after the other 
"perhaps one of the best things about this film 
"no situation is over-wrought 
this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play .
the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright .
"what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples 
"in fact 
"legs tap

but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ?
it just happened to work out for him .
"the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans

"this film features good performances 
director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it .
"but as a whole 
"the problem is that the writers 
"not that ambitious film-making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals 
"the film just ends up preachy 
"there's a thin line between satire and controversy 
"based on the book written by "" anonymous "" ( actually former "" newsweek "" writer joe klein ) 
but he doesn't actually play stanton .
he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) .
"the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) 
"he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations 
"richard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president's advisors 
"together they face all sorts of sexual allegations 
"in its satire and controversy 
"but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media 
seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look .
and the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden .
"at occasions 
there are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry's story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film .
"having said that 
but frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ?
"most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh 
"but as i mentioned before 
"although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely 
"thankfully 
it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens .
"however

"he's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors 
"he's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) 
"everything has simply made him a complete 
"but all of that changes when 
he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing .
"he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss 
"peter's friends and co-workers 
"not that michael bolton 
"but 
"as bleak as much of this sounds 
"although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip 
"each mundane detail 
"yet 
"ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced 
"his character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office 
"he is operating on a higher plane 
"anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy 
"in fact 
the animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity .
most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk .
"one employee 
"however 
it's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) .
"the film is flimsy and absurd 
"all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie 
"and while this uproariously funny 
american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season .
i must question the studio that releases a movie like this .
"the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd 
"some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 
"american pie was threatened with an nc-17 
"it is sick 
american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night .
"jim ( jason biggs ) 
"jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base 
"of course 
"there are many moments 
american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it .
i loved the young cast in this movie .
"consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with 
"biggs is more than enjoyable 
"but in a teen-dominated movie 
scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie .
"after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie 
but i never used baked goods . '
"it is performances such as his 
there are some less-than-original aspects of the film .
a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before .
"if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers 
"secondly 
"but at one point 
"and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate 
in it's own way .
"albert brooks saves the day 
"with a very poor summer for movies 
"while this may not be his finest work 
"in albert brook's latest comedy 
"in desperation 
"he asks jack for some help 
"so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) 
"the real punch line however 
"it really makes you wonder 
the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner .
"speaking of brooks 
"every time he graces the screen 
albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character .
the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone .
she wasn't likeable at all .
"brooks had the right idea with her occupation 
"in a way 
"luckily brooks could clean up the mess 
"it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance 
"on a brighter note 
"she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress 
"the funniest moments in "" the muse "" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese ."
"i mean imagine 
it was just plain hilarious .
"it just adds to the satire joke 
brilliant move by brooks .
"as i mentioned before 
"unlike bowfinger 
""" bowfinger "" had it's moments 
"by the end of the film 
"for once i'm not fully disappointed

i think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future .

"when it comes to modern gangster movies 
"i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea ."
"it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre 
the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it .
"we meet lefty ( pacino ) 
he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this .
"somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) 
"it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately 
i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit .
"however 
"the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor 
"the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements 
"most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) 
"thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime 
much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie .
pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would .
"he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does 
"we learn of his accomplishments 
"newell constantly plays up this aspect 
"as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty 
"most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia 
"the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout 
"the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies

"since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen

"it may be routine 
""" sometimes the 'green mile' seems sooooo long . """
indeed .
and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review .

"paul edgecomb ( tom hanks 
keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility .
"it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they "" talk to "" the convicts instead of yelling at them ."
this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars .
"into his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan 
"immediately 
perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark .
"or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he "" takes back "" paul's bladder infection thereby restoring him to health ."
"based on steven king's 1996 serialized novel 
"while it is mr . hanks "" everyman "" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes 
"all involved do credible work in their respective roles 
if only the story were more credible .
"writer/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual 
mr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters .
was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ?
"by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts' presence on e-block 
this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched .
"much has also been made of coffey's christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures 
"in contrast 
"the genuine "" gifts of healing "" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god ."
true spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed .
"such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism 
"i guess there are those who have never been kissed before ( a rare and dying breed ) 
rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties .

"in many ways 
"although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds 
"despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film 
"the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude 
"the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable 
the system formula .
"while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept 
the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing .
"there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves 
"in fact 
"still 
"i've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character 
"cheerfully going over the top 
ms . linney is a delight in the film .
but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here .
he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman .

it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention .
"in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic 
technical credits are first-rate all around .
"while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film 
"all the same 
"the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous 
perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question .
perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world .

"juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne 
"lena olin 
"judi dench is sharp

"victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk 
"a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women 
"that's not to say the men don't do their share 
"the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care

the question isn't why has grease been reissued .
the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .
"no 
the answer is not an easy one .
"grease is a fun movie 
"the music is lively and the dance numbers 
"travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon 
but grease didn't break any new cinematic ground .
it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider .
what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history .
"ok 
"grease is a fun and entertaining movie 
"it's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was 
he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly .
"cinematically 
"between grease and 1996's evita . 
"two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated 
"today 
"today's audiences lack the innocence 
"secondly 
"performers with the charisma 
"most singers and dancers remain on the stage 
"a good example is gregory hines 
"he danced a bit in the cotton club 
"so 
"if audiences show enough interest 
"perhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain 
"at one time or another 
"so 
let grease be the word that sparks this revival .
"let's face it : since waterworld floated by 
"with no new eye-candy for four weeks straight 
sigh .
thank god for desperado .
the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi--director robert rodriguez's notorious $7000 debut--stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name .
"he's a man in black with revenge on his mind 
( the woman he loved was killed in the first film . )
"so 
there isn't much of an emotional core to desperado .
rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo .
( and sergio leone . . .
and sam peckinpah . . . )
some may wince at the body count--at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate--but it's all played for laughs .
"big 
"sick 
"if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie 
"scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) 
"it starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story 
"because this is a tarantino movie 
the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems .
clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it .
"harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter 
"you know you're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive 
"the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border 
"it does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind 
"once they get to mexico 
"finally 
soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back .
"that's right 
"but like everything else 
"so we get holy water condom balloons 
"the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino 
"clooney 
"stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie 
"pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason 
"from dusk till dawn isn't the classic of modern cinema that pf is 
"the small-scale film 
"filled with breathtaking scenery 
the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review .
"the film starts out with a sharp opening 
what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore .
"who that person is 
"part detectives 
the village consists of several amusing characters .
"a clueless pig farmer 
there's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up .
there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] .
pacing is right .
"towards the end 
a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged .
in one brief dream sequence - you'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists .
one of the key moments in the film .
"the music 
a fine film that's for everybody except action fans .
"somewhat like 'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain 
but livelier .
"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group

"later 
"all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade

his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason .
"when bulworth decides he wants to live after all 
"at this point 
"bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) 
she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d .

"it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad

"when i saw the trailer for this film

"there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly

"he is perfectly cast in the role of ted 
"ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best

"lin shae 
"lee evans 
the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags .
the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes .
they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera .
it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film .

"yes

"in fact

ricci's character is funny and different .
"she doesn't care much that she has been kidnaped

"this film is about a real struggle

"this is a good film without big budget sets

"it might also seem cliche

"but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley

"the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband 
this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story .
"some are vital for only a few scenes 
"in most films only a few characters exist for support in background 
even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set .
the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place .
"the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside 
the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war .
fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is .
"one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming

"don't cut off my leg ! """
"another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street 
"as the second half begins 
"she manages to resurrect the family plantation 
this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship .
most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett .
"each uses the other for personal gain 
scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business .

"as they enter the pen 
"it's a small scene 
"after all

"the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view 
"by nature of this arrangement 
"in fact 
a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator .

"there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest 
"this 
"he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) 
julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior .

"it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them 
"and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton 
"devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses 
"in one scene 
matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale .
it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them .
"there is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke 
"matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment 
"more specifically 
"it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord

"think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny

if not well you get the jurisdiction .
having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake .

"geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price 
his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends .
steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list .
"somehow someone 
"eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player

everyone who was in there burned to death .
now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people .
"what starts out as a seemingly normal night 
the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed .
one-by-one the people start to disappear .
"conspiracies start to turn up 
"the people find rooms 
rooms which once had people dying .
rooms which may still contain these people .
"now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house 
since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better .
i can say however i liked this movie .
"geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price 
famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times .
ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs .
chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines .
peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims .
the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing .
"the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy 
i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous .
one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore .
"even though it had fantastic gore and special effects 
"the movie was written well 
the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it .
i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise .
"i was expecting another haunting with special effects 
"instead i found a good halloween movie with gore 
house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously .
though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws .

perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects .
there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise .
"whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years 
"the latest in this visually awesome series of movies 
"unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise 
"it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose 
"contrary to popular trend 
"in this regard 
"with its flashy mass stripped away 
"the script is characteristically weak 
"but 
the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner .
"and right around the corner they usually are 
"as the movie explains 
"billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- "" farms "" our life energy ."
"only a select group of individuals knows of the "" real "" world 
"morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) 
the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion .
"the set design is very dynamic 
"the costumes 
"for instance 
"the casting cannot be criticized 
"supports in carrie-anne moss 
"one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city 
"the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective 
"the better picture between the two depends on the viewer 
let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies .
"i adore them with such an unwavering 
was it any good ?
"well 
"now let me clarify 
"i'm partial to those gritty 
"problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes 
"so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off 
"truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets 
"yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish 
"as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's 
"as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film 
now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ?
"ooh that one really gets me going 
throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! )
into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city .
"how absorbing is prince of the city 
so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved .
"the film stars treat williams 
"since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city 
( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) .
like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have .
( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) .
"here 
"williams plays danny ciello 
they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes .
and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done .
"the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs 
"danny has done this 
"he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent "" ."
he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners .
right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do .
and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be .
"undercover cop films are almost innately exciting 
"how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal 
"prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive 
"lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back 
"his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension 
lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension .
"this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan 
"though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) 
some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic .
hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable .
"of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) 
for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills .
"it focuses completely on its story 
"there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches 
"this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon 
"in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness 
he's lost his voice .
does that little itty bitty detail matter ?
"maybe not to most 
"and in a sprawling epic of corruption 
"carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town 
"there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore

she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end .
"forget jurassic park 
"son-in-law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers 
"when son-in-law is long gone and forgotten 
this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it .

"although the basic story line has been done many 
"the laughs are plentiful 
"the way some of the jokes are done are new 
"there are also several new jokes that 
"still 
this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price .
the cast for this film does an excellent job .
pauly shore ( encino man ) is the star attraction of this film .
"he is great 
pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious .
this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role .
carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl .
"she makes her character believable 
"the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams

"bill condon's "" gods and monsters "" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) 
"since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film 
"whale 
"as the film tells it 
"james whale 
"in one of the opening scenes 
"because of this episode 
"clayon agrees 
"certainly 
""" gods and monsters "" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast 
"and in one heartbreaking scene 
"it is evident that whale's first love in his life was making movies 
"as played brilliantly by ian mckellen 
"he never hid the fact that he was gay 
"through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone 
"although boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes 
"since whale lives with only his loyal 
"although an extremely fine and mature picture 
"it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments 
"we know early on where these two characters are headed 
"in lesser hands 
"also 
"if the film was not going to follow up on this side story 
""" gods and monsters "" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture 
the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end .
"walking away from "" gods and monsters 
"it is a sad testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them 
"i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of "" good will hunting "" 
"the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law 
"professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) 
"this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff 
"a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain 
"will finds that the former is much easier than the latter 
"he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) 
"what makes "" good will hunting "" work so well 
"the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau 
"lambeau 
"and sean 
"will's reaction to this situation 
"for a film with such an extraordinary character 
"this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama 
""" good will hunting "" also has its share of fun humor 
"and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear 
"will's relationship with his friends 
"add all this to the fact that "" good will hunting "" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental 
"well 
"there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic 
"still 
"a cinematic version of one of john irving's novels is always cause for celebration even if 
"suggested means that irving 
that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product .
"irving's books are rich and complex works 
""" a prayer for owen meany "" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice 
"simon believes himself to be "" god's instrument 
"simon is played by ian michael smith 
"smith's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for "" simon birch "" ; however 
"another drawback is that in the book 
"watching "" simon birch 
"simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating 
"fortunately 
"simon is more of a catalyst 
"first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( "" jurassic park "" ) 
"mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old 
"ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca 
david strathairn and jan hooks play the town's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others .
there's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . .
"well 
"perhaps "" suggested by "" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all 
"the film also changes the book's ending to one that is more melodramatic 
"the flavor of irving's original novel remains 
"the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ 
"indeed 
"including this year's upcoming a midsummer night's dream 
"but for a change of pace 
brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love .
"marc norman and tom stoppard's story is largely fantasy 
"( will shakespeare of the 1590's would've been married to anne hathaway 
"with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) 
"the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet 
fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy .
"the supporting roles are well filled out 
"even ben affleck 
"the story is well-crafted if nothing else 
"the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted 
"there's something for everyone in this romantic comedy 
"although certainly not inspiring in any regard 
certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year's-open releases is just around the corner .

"jack dawson makes the trip 
"rose dewitt bukater 
"thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue 
"this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago 
"the movie titanic shows what happened 
now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story .
"it serves as both admirably 
"this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is 
the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective .
movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency .
the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable .
"the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting 
"part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting 
the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired .
the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles .
looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie .
"the casting for the movie could really have been better 
one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself .
"yes 
how is the titanic a character ?
"you ask well simple 
this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this .
mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense .
all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp .
"now 
the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking .
"in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there 
the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique .
"the movie will leave you amazed at the effects 
"the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions 
"now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies 
"the historical value of this movie is quite high 
"the method of telling the story is also good 
regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at .
the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing .
if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! !
it might not be the best movie in the world . .
but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it .
during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .
the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate .
people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future .
"after a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things 
the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth .
the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element .
the plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though .
"this movie has very good special effects 
the techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well .
bruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city .
one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk .
this movie is about what happens .
the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations .
"also there is a fair bit of action in the film 
some characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag .
bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does .
the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down .
"it is one of those sci-fi films where you'll be saying "" cool "" followed by a "" what the hell ? ! ? ! "" ."
i give the fifth element .

exotica is a film that grows on retrospection .
exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film .
"all of the people know each other

exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique .
"at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together 
"the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular

exotica is very much worth seeing .

"this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list 
"contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties 
"this one 
"in fact 
"not the original good 
because it's cute and innocent fun .
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with .

the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman
"when the soviet union imploded 
"with the united states friendly with the russians 
this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy .
it's time to rejoice because we've found our new villain .
"now it's no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands 
"a perfect solution 
"best of all 
so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid .
the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they're not sure even exists .
coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) .
mulqueen's ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal .
( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . )
the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn't slip away .
"crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van 
"being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller "" the day of the jackal "" 
"there is no doubt that the original is the better movie 
"as a mystery 
holes ? let's see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up .
"for a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks 
"the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police 
"willis' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer's in "" the saint "" ."
"( and lest you misunderstand 
but the three stars are fun to watch .
it's good to see gere in something other than a business suit .
"willis has a mixed history in picking projects 
"poitier is by far the superior actor 
"the problems in logic are flaws 
occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes .
this is one of them .

"review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie 
"but for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day

but dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead .
"this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado

"fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims 
"so when fox shows up to try and save each victim 
"fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list 
there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh .
"the movie starts off as a black comedy 
the mix between these genres are perfect .
"no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror 
one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman .
but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form .
"michael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death 
"alvarado 
"and jeffery combs 
the frighteners never once feels like it is running long .
"the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year 
this movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it .
"it's easily the best film of the year 
"before you read my review 
this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone .
"i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius 
"i love most of his films

the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives .
"in fact 
"so here i am again 
plot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator .

"the sets 
"but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters 
"i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old 
"of course 
"he actually plays a "" macho "" guy here and handles it pretty well 
"but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt 
"anyway 
"i didn't care much for her running joke about him "" dying "" whenever he left a room 
yum !
"harumph

"a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score

if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings .
"the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending 
"unfortunately for the devil's advocate 
"nevertheless 
i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan .
"well 
the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session .
"kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney 
"he ends up with a not-guilty verdict 
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury .
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife .
"after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) 
"he graciously accepts 
"he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) 
his life seems to be on the rise .
"and of course 
"he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) 
"mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice 
"meanwhile 
"he spends hours upon hours with this case 
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself .
"after a while 
"a fellow employee is murdered in the park 
is it all just a big nightmare ?
"or is john milton really satan 
"the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward 
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ?
"if so 
"i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film 
"i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally 
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? ) .
"the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending 
"films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected 
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way .
"the devil's advocate 
"if that is confusing 
"as for the film overall 
"the film runs like a well-built clock 
"and then you settle in for a nice resolution 
it was at this point that i felt cheated .
"taking us on a terror ride of intrigue 
everything occurs from his perspective .
he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) .
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game .
"i don't want to spoil the ending 
perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything .
it earned its r rating for a reason .
"there is plenty of nudity 
"this film really isn't subtle about anything 
"it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating 
"however 
"i don't condone sex and nudity in films 
the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch .
"the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining 
"portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron 
"this may sound uncaring 
"she is the most interesting character on the screen 
"something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity 
the story actually has something to say about humanity .
"in one of the last scenes 
he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity .
"then 
this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening .
"what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud 
"these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate 
"when a film has something to say about our society 
"the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights 
"heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case 
probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves .
"he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) 
i have never seen him more believable to date .
al pacino is of course the scene stealer .
his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) .
"he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes 
jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon .
judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past .
"connie nielson is very effective in her role 
"one familiar face with a twist was "" coach "" star 
"the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality 
"at 144 minutes 
"for the first two hours 
"the technical quality is also remarkable 
"director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture 
"i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film 
"but just before the end 
"personally 
"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist 
synopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy .
"in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head 
"to atone for his sins 
soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple .
but sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him .
opinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms .
"i believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer 
"duvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic 
"incidentally 
"since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist 
"in terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade 
"similarly 
"on the other hand 
"in terms of plot and pure entertainment value 
"teenagers 
"in other words 
the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is .
i mean that as the highest compliment .
"if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance 
"the sex scenes would be handled as a farce

"they decide to catch up on old times

"tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear

"the edge is rated r for graphic violence

"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review 
"one of such masterpieces is casablanca 
"its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere 
casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience .
"one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail 
"it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein 
"however 
"until this very day 
"the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda 
"in december 1941 
"thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america 
"many shady characters thrive on their misery 
"his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart )

"one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) 
"he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) 
"the couple needs visas 
"rick is now forced to choose between love 
"the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart 
"bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man 
"another icon in his company is ingrid bergman 
the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works .
"for many people 
"but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough 
the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads .
the supporting actors also did a marvellous job .
sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters .
another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny .

"like the great musical pieces of mozart himself 
"it is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class

there are almost too many reasons to explain .

"salieri feels envy

the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time .
scream was also known for its self-referential tone .
many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven .
"again 
scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's .
"sidney ( neve campbell ) 
"gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film 
"at the premiere of stab 
the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer .
"they want to know all about the links between stab 
the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference .
the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers .
the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press .
"the audience was watching the whole 
( whew . )
the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch .
"even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep 
the just add to the fun of watching it .
i recommend it for other reasons as well .
what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural .
no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible .
"it is a person in a mask and a robe 
no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer .
"the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies 
"the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette 
"they are likeable 
"but in combination with the horror aspect 
it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream .
"the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works 
"if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high 
"when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film 
a show about nothing ?
"sounds like "" seinfeld . """
a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ?
"sounds like "" the truman show . """
"what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants 
"which is why i was pleasantly surprised by "" edtv 
"the writing 
"in the hands of a less-experienced director 
"with their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) 
program director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment .
"the hook is to find a regular guy 
"while scouting possible candidates 
"but on watching the videotape 
"he's cute 
"cynthia's boss 
the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth .
""" action shot ! """
wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster .
you get the idea .
"but soon enough 
"ed's privacy is no longer his own 
who should ed go out with ?
you can be sure the pollsters have a list .
"not only is the film exceedingly well cast 
"matthew mcconaughey provides the face 
he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers .
"sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed's mother 
"jenna elfman ( from tv's "" dharma and greg "" ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau 
even degeneres and reiner are better than you'd expect .
"in 1979 
"the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film 
"as with most films by albert brooks 
"the funniest--and scariest--thing about "" edtv "" is that it is absolutely believable ."
"ingredients : james bond 
synopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth ship' to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing .
"super-agent james bond ( pierce brosnan ) uses trick gadgets 
this time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh ) .
"the film contains fights 
"opinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene 
it neither stands out nor disappoints .
in old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter .
tomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin .
"like leiter's character 
stars : michelle yeoh was born a leo in the western zodiac in the year of the tiger on the asian astrology calendar .
i dont believe in horoscopes .
but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers ( lts ) .
""" leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace ."
lts are unbelievably courageous when facing adversity .
"the lt is also classy 
this person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty .
"she delights in siblings 
sometimes annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes .
"in love life 
"in real life 
"like jackie chan 
she was born in malaysia - - a country of many languages - - and her primary language ( the language she speaks in her sleep ) is english .
"she was taught malay in school 
as an athlete michelle represented malaysia internationally .
"she enjoyed squash 
"she studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london 
"in 1983 she won the miss malaysia pageant - - without really intending to 
notoriety from the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine .
"michelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon ; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months 
"her comeback from retirement 
"it is not clear what michelles martial arts style is 
"of her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies 
my own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice .
it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback .
"of course 
"payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake 
"the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back 
"all we know is that gibson 
"it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) 
"obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul 
"porter 
"gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play 
"you probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat 
"harrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin 
"this is not to say that porter is a villain 
"while he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of 
"porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his 
"payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work 
"the only real problem with it is that 
"the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute 
"the film just ends far too suddenly 
"a fine film 
just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .
"if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild 
"while luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida 
"the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome 
"as tamora 
"however 
"taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks 
"she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist 
"she also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying 
"the clear standout of the cast 
lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain .

star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 )
review by matt pusateri
"few movies evoke nostalgia 
"the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers 
"arguably 
"so 22 years after the release of the original 
"can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke 
"against this challenge 
"and despite some early critical reviews in the major media 
"while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series 
"it is a worthy sequel - er 
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films .
"as the film opens 
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation .
"the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations 
"later 
"on tatooine 
"qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force . """
"as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows 
"complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure 
"while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet 
"if the plot sounds a bit complicated 
"the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis 
but the complexity is not overwhelming .
"the story moves quickly 
"one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing 
it's unclear whose story phantom menace is .
"in the original trilogy 
but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's .
"if this trilogy is centered on anakin 
"lloyd 
"on screen 
"the rest of the cast does fine 
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight .
mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility .
"portman fits the role of a young queen well 
"the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters 
"individually 
"but unlike the previous trilogy 
"in star wars 
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities .
"in the sequence in where luke 
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other .
"individually 
"this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film 
"but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction 
many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining .
"first 
"the characters visit magical underwater cities 
each location is elaborate and complex .
"lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings 
most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made .
"more than ever 
"the best such character is watto 
"watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short 
"of all the computer-generated characters in the film 
"speaking of computer-generated characters 
"with more than 80 minutes of screen time 
"jar jar 
"jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film 
"the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless 
"however 
he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene .
"throughout the movie 
"you accept that he's there 
"initially 
"on my second viewing of the film 
a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates .
"despite all the film's struggles between good and evil 
"fortunately 
"from the bumbling jar jar 
"in the film 
"and finally 
"from beginning to end 
"the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film 
the phantom menace won't win any major oscars .
it probably won't beat titanic's box office record .
"and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third 
"but it's an exciting and entertaining film 
"the film can't live up to it's hype - no film 
but it's still worth seeing . . .
probably more than once .
"the premise is simple 
a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made .
why ?
"it's torturous 
"based on the cult-favorite cable television series 
"mike nelson 
"the catch is 
"dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man 
the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man .
"we watch as the silhouettes of mike 
"in this case 
"we basically watch as our three leads watch 
"the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant 
"this island earth is the tale of two scientists 
together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet .
"to make mst3k work 
"mst3k 
"as funny as some of their observations are 
occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously .
"although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment 
"mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly 
"although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars 
"warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) 
"the name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny 
"most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say 
any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master .
"any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it "" more accessible "" to the general public ."
or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 .
"human traffic 
"the film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties 
"the cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) 
"koop ( shaun parkes ) 
nina herself can't stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends .
"lulu ( lorraine pilkington ) 
and moff ( danny dyer ) can't seem to escape the black hole of his awful life .
"the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love 
"human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive 
"the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well 
"dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace 
"however 
human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene .
"instead 
"steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for "" the new yorker 
"much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery 
"now 
"martin stars as bobby bowfinger 
"his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called "" chubby rain 
"bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately 
"ramsey 
"he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it 
the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time .
"ramsey is a member of mind head 
"( as if that's not familiar enough 
"when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "" white code "" in his face 
"murphy will probably win more fans as jiff 
"always surrounded by an entourage 
"furthermore 
"pacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer 
"murphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta "" clearing . """
not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention .
"his script is surprisingly clever as satire 
"( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating 
martin's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture .
"as expected 
"most of bowfinger is universally funny 
bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath .
"we're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem "" chubby rain 
"( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz's last directorial effort 
these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece .
"as i mentioned at the start of this review 
"that said 
"martin gets sentimental by story's end as he did in l . a . story 
"for those who can hack it 
>from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 )
comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast .
plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students .
she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida .
"the counselor is brought to court on the charges 
"as the story unfolds 
"critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points 
"mind you 
"and besides 
really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) .
"other than that 
"denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment 
"bacon is solid 
"sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters 
"on the down side 
i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court .
"murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex 
"little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph 
hoser ! )
"director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together 
"kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother 
how many of us would become strippers ?
"for those of us who wouldn't 
"that's probably not a fair question 
"as you watch the full monty 
would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ?
"in case you haven't guessed 
it's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication .
"it is the story of six out-of-work 
what to do ?
it hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis .
it seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash .
"eventually 
"these include the overweight 
"when the sextet is complete 
"we watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers 
"as if there anti-appeal wasn't enough 
.
.
and i mean * all * .
the movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add .
it's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater .
"with the subject matter 
"the amount of light 
"there's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words 
"each character is completely individual 
"the full monty is never offensive 
"it's one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment 
"either way you see it 
"and 
"director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock 
"nicolas cage plays memphis 
"memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise 
"memphis sets out to put his old crew back together 
gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits .
"in that sequence 
"filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence 
and what follows doesn't disappoint . . .
cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . .
good or bad . . .
"i don't know how he does that ) 
"of the supporting cast members 
"also 
none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately .
some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles .
"delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis 
i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important .
the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . .
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll .
"there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen 
"as it stands 
"but if i was making this film 
thereby adding some meat to the plot .
"the finale is essentially just a big car chase 
it's all been done .
"the chase is also shot and edited in that "" jerry bruckheimer action sequence "" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene ."
"sure it's a car chase 
it's very hard to tell .
"finally 
department .
"despite those minor complaints 
"it's not thought provoking 
just what a summer flick should be .
[pg-13]
"books could be 
"this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s 
"the special effects were groundbreaking 
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it .
"and now 
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now .
"some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection 
"either way 
can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ?
"in a way 
"it's a story about a young man's coming of age 
"it's high adventure 
something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and
it's about to do so again .
"this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans 
"interviews 
"or 
) .
pictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even
"months before the movies were released 
"in some cases 
"the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here 
"for instance 
"and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling 
"all the starships and fighters are now computer-animated 
"four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added 
"however 
"the negatives 
"the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed 
"and _that_ 
it's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen .
even letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition .
"in regard to the star wars special edition 
go and see it more than once . . . it
may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time .
take along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time .
"there's magic in this movie--special edition or no 
"let's all return to that time long ago 
eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career .
"known for his notorious late 80's slump 
"with the exception of the dreadful holy man 
"life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence 
"director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own 
"life is 
"amazingly 
"as the movie opens 
there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) .
"somehow 
"when all is said and done 
"hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison 
"the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's 
"luckily 
"not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old 
"murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles 
this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve .
"while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy 
"but the comedic aspects work wonderfully 
"the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama 
"i could say a few bad things about the movie 
"it's such a nice surprise 
"cinematically speaking 
"a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action 
"yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned 
the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft .
"while the fact that the strong 
this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is .
"much like the film that started the franchise 
"contrary to what has been reported over the past few months 
"the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) 
"however 
"when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal 
"but that's easier said than done 
"peoples--or 
"peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time 
"however 
"it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating 
"then again 
"bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ 
"collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened 
busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan .
"registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price 
"( jackson also has little to "" do "" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside

"instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table

"bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning 
bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure .
"the opening sequence is a series of clumsy

"we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power

"when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair 
"it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit

"the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous 
"however

"he does this repeatedly 
"while there might be symbolic value in this

"the latest epos from lars is a blast 
this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something .

"in these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess

"at first she resist 
imagine what this is doing to the poor girl ?
"the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby 
the use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre .
"the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant 
i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) .
"emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances 
"the screenplay is now available in print 
anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases . . .
( especially hercules ) . . .
emotion .
all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together .
not since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works .

"they pick anya to pose as their princes 
"dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner 
the plot is actually quite well structured .
"there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later 
what this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either .
"there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny 
"there is

"even without the voices 
"the musical number in paris is a show-stopper 
"as with all recent animated features 
"the songs are all very catchy 
i can't reccomend anastasia highly enough .
it's a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics .
"kids and adults alike will enjoy it 
i can hear the question already .
what on earth do these two movies have in common ?

"so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots 
why ?
"with both films 
you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk .
the title is generic .

"( if you can find a bootleg copy 
"this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire 
the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow .
here's the rundown .
van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double .
"turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother 
alain does some investigating .
"he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city

"the story is adequate 
"there's a love story 
"she's great to look at 
"of course 
"the movie is exceptionally violent 
( keep that in mind when planning your date . )
"the stunts are spectacular 
"there's only so much you can do with a car wreck 
"and lam has a surprising 
"the main difference between lam and woo 
"don't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled 
but it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood .
"( for one thing 
"while woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart 
"the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city 
"the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style 
"the performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular 
"the story is a little mundane 
"but it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture 
"van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie 
"in many ways 
there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold .
"but 
his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry .
the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) .
these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough .
their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive .
"given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime 
"yet 
"actually 
"they just improvise along the way 
"their next scheme 
"if all goes well 
"what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family 
"moreover 
these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations .
they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high .
"but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher 
"the next hour or so 
"during this time 
"because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping 
we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause .
"as a result 
"the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings 
"the momentum and the coolness of the film 
you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement .

"that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli 
"from what i've seen of their movies ( "" kiki's delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) 
"these movies 
""" kiki's delivery service "" starts with an unusual premise : kiki 
"this is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world 
"her mother is also a witch 
"just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences 
"kiki must choose a city to move to

this is where the movie becomes shockingly good .
kiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her .
"the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial 
"they're three- dimensional 
"however 
"the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive 
"this beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in 
"i could probably go on all day 
"some of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet 
in the garage of a deliveree's house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend .
such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg .
added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth .
"kiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her 
this causes kiki to lose faith in herself .
"however 
"seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous 
"the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and 
"the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence 
"however 
"refreshingly enough 
""" beauty and the beast "" 's beautiful belle

"another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for "" kiki's delivery service "" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be 
"the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold 
i'm not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states .
"disney tentatively plans a theater release of "" monoko hime "" shortly following the summer '97 japanese release 
i'd guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release .

"john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women

"rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and

martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me .
"because of his reputation 
"as much as i enjoyed them 
i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story .
no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies .
"for example 
there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on .

"the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama 
"the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom . """
his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story .
( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . )
we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old .
his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama .
a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before .
several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items .
the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own .
"the boy picks correctly 
scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk .
"before selecting an item 
"sometimes he picked right the first time 
"either way 
">from this point on 
it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child .
in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services .
but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage .
"neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable 
certain patterns take shape over the years .
"for example 
"radios 
"when he is old enough to accept his leadership 
"he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain 
it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter .
"but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor 
"tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china 
the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays .
"the movie ends when 
the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do .
it just doesn't fit that mold .
"if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet 
the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that .
"the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events 
"perhaps because the pace is slower 
"a mandala 
the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold .
"the bricks are a rich reddish brown 
even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet .
"philip glass composed the music for kundun 
"for those who don't know of glass 
"his building blocks are lots of small notes 
these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition .
"people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending 
it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person .
"on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese 
robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often .
it is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years .
"until 1994 
"the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy 
"a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because "" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct 
"all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased 
it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears .
"but certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots 
upon my first viewing i left bawling .
"it is not flawless -- but it is so very good 
"the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long 
"martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope 
that is what a river runs through it does .
it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self .

the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider .
"when those observers are joel and ethan coen 
"when the life is that of jeff "" the dude "" leboswki 
"the marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film ."
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up .
"the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles 
"spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other 
"when asked what he does for fun 
lebowski's passion is bowling .
"when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike 
"arriving home one night 
"even worse 
the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife .
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment .
"the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor ."
"the next day 
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there .
"when he's denied any money 
"on his way out 
the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine .
later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers .
this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences .
the kidnappers are impossibly inept .
the dude and his cronies are even worse .
every plan goes awry .
you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues .
"that's the story 
there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining .
the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into .
"the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but 
walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties .
everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam .
"when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it 
donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling .
"when he does 
"donny is "" out of his league "" and doesn't "" have a frame of reference "" ."
"the film is peppered with people for whom the term "" character "" would be an understatement ."
"the big lebowski's daughter maude 
the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers .
bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star .
most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler .
"as the flamenco music swells 
"the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with "" jesus "" ( pronounced with a "" j "" 
he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail .
his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball .
bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has .
i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job .
"buscemi has a limited role 
the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time .
it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband .
"more like the coen's "" raising arizona "" than their hit "" fargo ""

"down with america concerns a government agent

the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s .

"with an about ten minute running time

from there we go into a delightful parody .
"the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth 
we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast .
"although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' 
"for once 
i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself .
it's almost as much fun as the film .
"here is a film that is so unexpected 
"okay 
"most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s 
"however 
"a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far 
"but 
"it's well made 
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film .
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements .
it's about how much it can get into one film .
"and yet 
"species ii begins in the present day 
"many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one

"the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger

what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay .
"in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college 
"this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later 
"the script uses this effectively 
"beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing )

"the characters are all smart 
"the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) 
"there are the obvious flaws of course 
"the special effects are only mediocre 
"but for the most part 
"also 
"however 
"many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex 
"however 
what were the alien films about ?
"and 
my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store .
i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) .
the acting is quite good for this kind of film .
"it is a vast improvement over the first film 
"the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad 
"okay 
"george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting 
"natasha henstridge is limited this time around

"oh yeah 
"marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around 
"michael madsen is so-so

"critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board

"the film gets right into the "" dirty "" side of

fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike .
"he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind 
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all .
"john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on 
john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play .
he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast .
"cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women 
she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date .
catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself .
the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever .
"spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut 
he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie .
by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was .
the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking .
the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming .
the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles .
"from cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard 
"there isn't a slow point in the movie 
"there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original 
"i found myself amazed by everything : the direction 
by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore .
or why they don't .
all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out .
this was a surprise hit as was american beauty .
"'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year 
it has something that no other movies playing now has .
in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now .
i highly recommend 'being john malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed .

everything comes together here .

"gere's client 
the evidence is stacked against him .
he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop's blood .
his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene .
he has a relationship with the priest .
"gere talks to the boy 
"despite the lawyer's proclamations that he doesn't care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people's lives 
lots of complications and twists .
the prosecuting attorney is gere's former co-worker and lover .
they both work each other's motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy .
her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections .

gere's case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas .
"gere is exceptional as the well-dressed reserved counselor 
"even when he loses it 
norton's aaron is convincing : he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city .

"glory--starring matthew broderick 
"broderick plays robert gould shaw 
"shaw 
"the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard 
"as the film begins in 1862 
"like private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war 
"shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle 
"soon after his recovery 
"glory is the story not only of colonel shaw 
the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers .
"the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits 
"the large black cast is uniformly outstanding 
"he is brash and pushy 
"his bitter 
washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power .
"in one heartbreaking scene 
"when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment 
it makes your blood boil .
the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well .
the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores .
"freeman is 
he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember .
"he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers 
"colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major 
"andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles 
"searles is educated and refined 
the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat .
the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment .
"the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships 
"the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens 
"they are paid only $10 a month 
"to make matters worse 
"eventually 
"shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers 
"broderick 
"unfortunately 
"in an effort to look more mature 
he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced .
"the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers 
glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war .
the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july .
glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts .
"except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head 
"to the contrary 
the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers .
the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals .
"in one scene 
each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration .
"a couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe 
"the regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle

"john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films 
"
john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes .
"for a writer and director of horror films 
"ghosts of mars is called a horror movie 
"in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars 
"this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 
"it is 
but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience .
ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 .
mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) .
"it is never mentioned 
"society has changed a bit by that time 
apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control .
"and from carpenter's view 
society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten .
"the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes 
"instead of having the criminal "" napolean "" wilson 
"instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face 
"because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner 
"the story is told in flashback 
"ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red 
"carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene 
sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup .
the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss .
his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring .
these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience .
somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights .

this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs .
"it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there 
garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection .
denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular .
so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit .
"she soon learns why "" easier said than done "" is the mantra of movies like this ."

no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage .
also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight .
that's how it works in movies like these .
"i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile 
i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet .
"garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival 
milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together .
rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara .
"oh 
what the message here ?
"sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction

"and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics 
"this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer 
by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting .
the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu .
the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay .

he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents .
"in paris 
"he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk 
"d'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre 
"director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles 
"one problem is that 
jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around .
"ironically 
"most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences 
"the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) 
chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer !

"to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie 
the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong .
"tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie

"the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * "" knock off "" to the point where the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more ."
another problem with the film is that it looks cheap .
the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night .
"and for some inexplicable reason 
even the stars .
"and even the special effects

""" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing ."
"it's not just because this is a brian depalma film 
"and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance 
it's worse than that .
"it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more

"in certain circles 
"in one very very very long steadicam shot 
"there's a big name in the crowd

"we follow the wrong character 
"but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring 
"it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film 
"it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in

"unfortunately 
forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects .
"set in 1692 at salem 
they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells .
then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes .
"not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) 
"taking even adolescent hormone surges into account 
surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ?
the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play .
"this is far from a harmless event 
"the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply 
"in the film 
not only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted .
it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot .
"not surprisingly 
"when the girls are questioned 
"with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents 
"abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love 
"appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) 
director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration .
"otherwise 
ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings .
her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful .
"abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power 
"paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth 
"probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing 
a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed .
"unfortunately 
it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions .
his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message .
"the result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene 
"when the gallows beckoned 
"far from bewitching 
one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film .
"after all 
"he is also an esteemed film critic 
"however 
"the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit 
"these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young 
"it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup 
"whether this project will end up a play 
"the thesis is simple enough that 
"instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes 
"only once does any character utter something worthwhile 
"but don't fret 
"you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in 
but you hold hope for some time .
"the background music keeps you in a state of urgency 
it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope .
"and with speeches like 
"to godard's credit 
the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful .
watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him .
"and if this film had anything poignant to say 
"the environments 
"unfortunately 
"sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings 
the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image .
you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners .
the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies .
steven spielberg is picked on in particular .
"while i'll grant that this does happen 
"it just goes to show 
the days of breathless are no more .
america loves convenience .
"after all 
"yet perhaps this time 
"ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails 
"when she and her comrades 
"filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks 
the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story .
"ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie 
attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced .
"most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom 
"with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other 
"apparently 
"but 
"yes 
"and as we all know 
"characters die 
"as long as you have plenty of narcotics 
"eventually though 
"what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation 
explosions are fun .
"and even if the nukes don't get them 
"in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces 
"for 
"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others 
"the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) 
his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .
"i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard 
it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie .
and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?
"auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" 
"kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more "" ."
"and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view

""" how did you know that ? """
"the stunned protagonist asks

.
"since twist endings are currently so in vogue 
he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .
this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles .
"their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends "" ."
"reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy 
"although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness 
affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch .
"the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) 
"it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction 
"james frain is nick 
ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him .
"which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot 
"he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who 
"though by the end 
"this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which 
included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .
"though it's an action film 
"the flick was directed by john frankenheimer 
it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau
"( you remember 
he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart .
problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .
"character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre 
the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .
but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .
"charlize theron 
she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .
"gary sinise has played this role frequently 
these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .

just as unlikely .
"with "" 102 dalmatians 
"1996's "" 101 dalmatians "" certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time 
"in addition 
"this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen 
but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film .
"what makes "" 102 dalmatians "" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog 
"gruffudd is cute and harmless

"basically 
"there's a lot of water 
it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense .
the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around .

"how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "" inspired "" by something like that ?"
this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence .
instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa .
he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him .
"after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport 
assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) .
caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career .
of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison .
"and then there's the inevitable "" heartless meanie "" character 
he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell .
"let's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen 
any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way .
not good old theo .
"no 
this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems .
"director jon turteltaub 
it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) .
"it aims to "" inspire "" rather than to touch hearts ."
"as yoda would say 
it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story .
"indeed 
"this 
i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation .
"i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors 
oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful .
his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink .
i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling .
"i love animals 
however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable .

"sci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script 
battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes .
here's the `plot . '
the year is 3000 .
mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) .
a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below .

"then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry

"roger christian 
and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth .
christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie !
and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really .
the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit .
travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect .
jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! '
then there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve .
why ?
because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid . '
"terel may be right 
humans made this movie .
"would you believe -- in real life 
let me tell you what reality is .
"reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts

and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ?

"the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act 
"thankfully 
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks .
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line .
"the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out 
there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot .
"while we are on the subject of the story 
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office .
"i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary 
the script for this film is completely pathetic .
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible .
the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along .
here is an example of the wonderful dialog .
the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun .

the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence .

are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ?
the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film .
"in one shot 
very impressive trick !

tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie .
"the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage 
enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious .
the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium .
"tectonic plates has a storyline 
"it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious 
"art ! "" ) 
although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters .
"because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie 
"they're not real 
"i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different 
"tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) 
"one day 
"while preparing to commit suicide 
"meanwhile 
"with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland 
"however 
"the tone is soporific 
"tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth 
"there are some worthwhile moments 
"the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different

"volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo 
"deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities 
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .
"deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future

"well 
"suggestion to ms . leder : please 
"much of the blame can be placed on leder directly 
throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .
it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring .
"of course 
screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .
what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .
"chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know

"only one of the subplots is remotely interesting 
"and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action

"that's right 
"scenes above the earth are well done 
"but the comet is a huge mistake 
"the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough

leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror .
"this reminded me of another action director 
but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .
"leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces 
one moment has an astronaut flying off into space .

"the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 
"extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and "" special project consultant "" scott michael bosco 
the transfer on this international version is incredible . . .
you'd think you were watching a new release .
"images are sharp 
"only some special effects sequences show the wear of time 
"the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places 
the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries .
bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track .
"bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen 
"although 
"we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track 
great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out .
"as it stands 
"for the sake of brevity 
"szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own 
"bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along 
"again 
"anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 
disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release .
"disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film 
"the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note 
"the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono 
one question though . . .
shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ?
i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd .
"i was nine when it was released to theaters 
so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect .
"i knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before

so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started .

""" sleepy hollow "" is his first attempt to actually scare people ."
i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this .
i left disappointed .
"andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story "" the legend of sleepy hollow . """
in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors .
ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders .
several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman .
"although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him 
"he also discovers that the killings are not random 
along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) .
my reaction : ho-hum .
the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting .
that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages .
"however 
"it might be his background -- in his previous movies 
"along the same lines

the performances are also awful .
"although he's impressed me with his work in other films 
"ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic 
the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish .
"the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee 
"i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations 
"coppola is an executive producer for "" sleepy hollow

what's not so good about it :
"lame

suspense scenes that are just plain boring .
"ridicously trite characterization makes the entire south out to be ingnorant

"my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve

overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities
one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances .
"now i've never seen seven chances 
"o'donnell plays jimmie shannon 
"he also fears commitment 
his reasons ?
"well he's a guy you see 
i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) .
"eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose 
"he essentially says to her 
the audience should now hate this character .
i did .
then the meat of the plot presents itself .
"jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov 
"however 
"having blown his chances with anne 
"the movie wasn't half bad by this time 
"it wasn't boring me 
"ustinov's character left a video will 
"as soon as i thought it 
it was quite surreal .
something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive .
"up to that point 
at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers .
"when jimmie has no other options 
"at this point 
these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman .
"when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks 
"as a result 
this goes on for the rest of the film .
"it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 
my groans of disgust could be heard for miles .
"the film finally ended ( thankfully ) 
the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video .
"it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 
"the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc 
"apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city 
"so that was bad enough to be cut 
ugh .
the happy bastard's quick movie review
holy man
more like holy crap .
the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands .
"somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel 
"it's here that he seems to hit his stride 
"at this point in the movie 
"it doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush 
only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie .
murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else .
"some may argue that the movie has a message 
at least he has something for us to laught at . . .
forget get carter .
instead . . .
get me a cup of coffee .
what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?
did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?
"when did all of the bad-ass 
the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city .
get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .
stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .
"a few years ago 
that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .
stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .
"too bad get carter returns stallone to action 
get carter is a simple story .
"stallone plays frank carter 
"when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident 
"he talks tough with his brother's wife 
"carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool 
carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .
what a minute !
"this sounds just like another film i saw last year 
better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .
"actually 
"while stallone still carries his own weight here 
"throughout the film 
"his one-liners fall flat 
there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .
the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .
"an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs 
"he may not win any oscars 
"get carter has great directing 
the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .
never mind that it should never have been made at all .
"a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle "" heaven can wait "" ( which in turn was a remake of "" here comes mr . jordan "" ) 
"when he's taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes ( eugene levy 
"he chooses that of charles wellington 
"of course 
"the original elaine may/warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock 
to turn beatty's vehicle as a football player into rock's vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor .
"as directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ( codirectors of "" american pie "" and costars of "" chuck & buck "" ) 
initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals .
production values are shoddy .
most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate .
this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen .
"rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick 
"you got a bed ! ' ) 
regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis .
"also good is frankie faison ( "" hannibal "" ) as whitney 
chaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven's ambassadors .
"another "" best in show "" alumnus 
"mark addy ( "" the full monty "" ) is sorely underutilized as cisco 
"stealing the show in every scene she's in is wanda sykes ( "" the chris rock show "" ) as wellington's disgruntled maid ."
""" down to earth "" is for chris rock fans only ."
"all others should go rent "" heaven can wait "" or truly be brought down to earth ."
what would you do if no one could see you ?
"well 
that's right .
"of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible 
"er 
something sounds horribly wrong already .
"but this is a paul verhoeven film 
""" hollow man "" features a string of hapless 
"oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of "" thermal "" shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support ."
"since invisibility 
it's as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is
simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin .
"as a horror film 
it's minor verhoeven--and even that's not saying much--and boy is it hollow .
"roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast 
"ben kingsley ? """
"my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark 
"they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild 
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .
"gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain ."
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .
the second punch comes from gal's past .
"back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane 
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .
"don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly . """
"however 
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .
"beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear 
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .
"additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault 
"no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether 
"in spite of the provocative title 
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .
"the story is usually of the reformed outlaw 
"the old gang 
it is not a great plot .
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .
it is an old plot dressed up to look new .
"if the plot is old 
"this is director jonathan glazer's first film 
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .
we see one side of a person's faces .
"but the other side fades into the darkness 
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .
us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .
"at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking 
"sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre 
"the plot may be new to british crime films 
further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .
i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
apparantly money talks .
.
.
and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so !
"i've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess 
"i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard 
"it's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) 
"perhaps if one character were foul mouthed 
money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) .
franklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him .
"when the plot finally gets underway 
"the frenchman who's somewhat responsible for franklin's escape from a prisoner-packed bus 
"franklin's only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) 
james offers to help clear franklin's name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week .
"both of these elements are completely lost along the way however 
"as expected 
"there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film 
money talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience .
"frivilous dialogue 
"starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king 
"therefore 
"despite some innovation and risk taking 
"a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the "" savages "" that live there ."
the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust .
only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash .
"the ending 
the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth .
"governor ratcliffe 
"captain john smith is a blond hunk who 
pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time .
she even comes complete with insignificant best friend .
"again 
"this is an odd compromise 
"the animals are a delight 
maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes .
"the talking tree 
"the music 
"mel gibson 
the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character .
i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time .
even the children in the audience seemed restless .
while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed .
perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history .
"it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value 
"even the artwork 
"as mentioned above

"[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound 
"the big-budget 
"gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin 
""" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre ."
"it's made up of every element of science fiction 
"audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films 
"battle scenes are worthless without tension 
"in essence 
we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources .
"each member of the family has a special trait and personality 
"professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent 
"of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other 
"the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire 
"the first act is not a building of a story 
we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent .
"in fact 
"yes 
"they say things that only relate to the conflict 
it's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens .
"eventually the pacing rapidly increases 
"the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) 
what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts .
"the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as "" alien "" -lite ."
the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive .
but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly .
"plotlines are developed 
"the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes 
"by the time the last act rolls around 
"the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax 
""" lost in space "" is major film production at its worst ."
"it's frightening that a film so poorly written 
the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective .
"such is the case with _urban legend_ 
the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends .
examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house .
"the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up 
i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days .
"anyhow 
it's a very good setup that promises more chills to come .
"unfortunately 
the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus .
"like most slasher flicks 
i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill .
"after the fine first scene 
these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music .
"i guess sudden 
the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast .
"the slasher appears 
false scares should always be used in moderation .
someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be .
this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening .
remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ?
this movie still adheres to them .
tons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list .
and i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense .
that type of illogical can be fun .
this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember .
the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming .
"actually 
"at its best 
the film still manages to have some strong points .
the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans .
there are some intentionally funny moments .
( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . )
the film is well made from a technical standpoint .
"besides the first part 
"if there had only been more sequences like this 
my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love .
i love ralph fiennes .
i love uma thurman .
i love sean connery .
"hell 
"i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago 
"a few months into the summer 
"then 
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations .
"this is a lousy 
"i would slam it harder 
"but sets are ultimately empty 
"that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves 
"it's like a chore 
"it also feels like its been cut to pieces 
this is just plain depressing .
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode .
i wasn't alive then .
i don't even watch television now .
"i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective 
"i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel 
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .
"based on what the film told me 
"they are to work together 
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .
his name is de wynter ( connery ) .
he is a crazy scottish guy .
"our heroes had better stop him 
.
.
"the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines ) ."
"along the way there is subplot after subplot 
"for example 
"now 
"the purpose of the bugs 
"they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman 
"the special effects aren't bad 
"like so many scenes in the film 
"and i guarantee you 
i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think .
the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens .
there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut .

virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective .
the plot is incoherent and full of holes .

"the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate 
"i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller

"dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy

the problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre .
the result is that the entire production feels contrived .
i'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones .
"now while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones 
"just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between "" entrapment "" and "" blackmail "" ."
"with an eighty million dollar budget 
"well 
the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular .
"unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment 
"the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture 
many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing .
one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask .
"nothing wrong with that 
i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) .

the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it .

"batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin 
"those days of the dark knight are gone 
""" batman and robin "" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness ."
the blame lies with director joel schumacher .
"a former window-dresser 
"unfortunately 
""" batman and robin "" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who ."
"while the characters flail at each other

it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one .
"ironically

"the film's most effective scene is a tender

"thurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though 
"the biggest lesson to be learned from "" batman and robin "" is that more is not better ."
joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is .
some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam .
i don't think so .

maybe she is one of the producer's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something .
we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating .
"he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue 
"starts to drown

"of course there must be a villain 
"he never raises his voice or becomes angry 
"it's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film

there's a world of difference between artists and technicians .
the artist has a vision to create something new .

"he's spent his career copying others

nasa has set its sights for mars .

and it's all so boring .
"there are so many scenes that just don't work 
"when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path 
error .
the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off .
error .
the alien is laughable .
error .
the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable .
error .
there's some nice eyecandy .
"the face on mars 
a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world .
maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic .
but there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before .
"from "" 2001 "" 
">from "" close encounters "" 
the list goes on .
the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues .
even gary sinise and tim robbins can't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing .
no one seems to care about anything that happens .
you won't either .
"the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper 
they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .
mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .
something else is what he did .
the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .
meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .
she wants to build a career as an actress .
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .
she does not know who the woman is .
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .
"they fix on a name rita for her 
meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .
"he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else 
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .
there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .
he just chooses not to .
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .
"there are no earthworms 
the film is a little long for the subject matter .
"toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes 
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
mulholland drive spoiler warning .
i have rated this film fairly low .
you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .
david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .
what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )
playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .
the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .
the audience expectation is that they will add up .
but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .
lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .
"in fact 
there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .
mad magazine called it a poiuyt .
other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .
look at small portions of it and makes sense .
look at the whole figure and it does not .

christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . .
and nobody wins .
"the hunted is such a bad movie 
"i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it 
christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan .
he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) .
apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered .
"since lambert is a witness 
let's stop and think about this for a second .
"if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society 
"in this movie 
i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body .
you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is .
"this is 
"lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada 
"they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence 
the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them .
"lone 
the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him .
"in the hunted 
"what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver 
"also 
"there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory 
"by the time we get to the final showdown 
we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !
"someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies 
"this movie bungles two out of three 
hello kids .
"today the movie studios want to take over my critical review

"and it has will patton as a long lost husband trying to reunite with his separated wife and child 
"gurgle 
and it has steve buscemi spewing more one-liners about minors and strippers .

watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble !
stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie .
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless .
when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ?
"and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) 
"in the film version of his autobiography of the same name 
"if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie 
( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs .
is this hollywood . . . california ? )
i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead .

"question : it's obvious the babies are super-smart 
the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers .

"instead 
"which brings us to the performances 
mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .
she actually looks scared during her one love scene .
but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse .
so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .
even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly .

poster boy for co-dependency needs patching
patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman
mediocrity is a pox on civilization .
"in our heavily consumer oriented society 
what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ?
"to make us buy more 
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality .
the film industry is like any other .
"in order for studios to survive 
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit .
"some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that 
there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary .
"for some reason 
"often 
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies .
"i'm not suggesting that "" patch adams "" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks ."
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel .
"it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story 
"hunter "" patch "" adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis ."
"checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt 
patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency .
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems .
"he decides that he wants to be a physician 
"as a med student 
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students .
"he writes in patch's academic file that he shows "" excessive happiness . """
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing .
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies .
then it struck me .
it must be based on a true story .
"the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute 
robin williams is an amazing actor .
"while he is adept at dramatic roles 
that's what makes his failure here so remarkable .
"patch is exactly the character he should be best at 
something holds him back .
most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional .
"for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings 
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person .
unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes .
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .
we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them .

""" patch "" is a good title for the film ."
it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of .
the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types .
there's a touching death .
then there's another .
the film doesn't trust us to get it the first time .
the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again .
worst of all is the final courtroom bit .
scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people .
the room is packed with patch's supporters .
williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all .
"it has as much emotion as his earlier statement "" humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species "" contains truth ."
most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk .
"shadyac also directed the first "" ace ventura "" movie ."
oedekerk directed the second one .
need i say more ?
the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases .
the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .
"the "" doctors are not gods "" theme will resonate with a number of people 
"young einstein is embarrassingly lame 
"in the u . s . 
"personally 
"young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious 
his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you'd expect from someone named yahoo .
the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth .
"whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany 
"in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity 
yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity .
"although yahoo's performance is at first endearing 
"yahoo has created a charming family for albert 
"but after the first twenty minutes 
young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot .
"yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately 
almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video .
"the instrumental score 
"halfway through young einstein 
but it wasn't until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms .
"in fact 
this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james .
"dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom "" doc "" scholl ( peter butterworth ) 
"owing to the increased occurrence of turpin's robberies 
they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) .
"their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) 
"however 
"then again 
there is no doubt that this is a 'sid james' carry on movie .
he excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- don't lose your head' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious .
"barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang 
jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part .
"peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom 
"the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree 
"when her girls and her are robbed by turpin 
"a carry on by the numbers 
"the jokes are bluer 
"although nearly all the regulars appear 
none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here .
just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres .
"one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek

"when lance is seriously injured 
"his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend 
guess who wins ?
nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love .
there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow .
van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes .
"also 
"he's still a pseudo-intellectual 
voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out .

"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting 
"visually there is much to like about this version 
that makes it a film without much center .

"pierre boulle 
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels .
"humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed 
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .
"it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals 
"when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 
the final irony of the original version has become film history .
"without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series ."
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .
"that could have been done in the film 
"serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and 
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .
"but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language 
"few viewers questioned this serious plot hole 
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best .
"when the film's success called for sequels 
"while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted 
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .
"for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book 
"first 
"he has them both be intelligent 
"that could be a good story too 
"as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century 
"in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg 
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .
"( yes 
"he quickly finds 
and the language they talk is earth- english .
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .
"leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari 
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .
she is bent on making the world a better place .
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .
"in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout 
she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .
it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .
this is a further abandonment of the source material .
"the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society 
we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .
we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .
burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .
"this is a miscalculation 
they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .
"the 1968 script had little subtlety 
most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .
the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .
this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .
in general it seems much improved from 1968 .
"the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers 
in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .
it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .
"chambers is good 
today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement .
these visuals work nicely .
what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .
"they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger 
apes spring incredible distances .
"some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture 
one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .
since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .
the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .
"it is not that his lines are so good 
but he delivers them very well .
"he was always a watchable actor 
"as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up 
in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .
he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus .
as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .
"danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel 
that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .
i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 .
the best way i can put it is that it's funky .
"i know this is an odd question 
it's just like that .
"anyway 
"this time 
it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me .

jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today .

"ten months later 
"using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing 
smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate .
he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization .
blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital .
"sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally

the fox mulder detachment doesn't work here .
oscar-winner hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on .
"played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer 
most of the time hutton looks as if he's searching for his character and coming up empty .
jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery .
the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen .
the rest aren't any better .
michael massee's eccentric fbi agent never revs up .
"one of blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer's doc holliday in "" tombstone "" ."
his two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film .

"i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role

"swordfish is loud 
it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life .
and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ?
by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists .
swordfish is a very cynical movie .
"it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human

"this is a live-action road runner cartoon

talk about whacked-out patriotism .
my objections to swordfish are many .
"the body count is high 
"it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers 
"another example is the family dynamics between stanley 
"stanley 
audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films .
"thus when she is found murdered late in the movie 
"in fact 
then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel .
children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films .
there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well .
"yea 
"travolta is cool 
his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off .
jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings .
his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database .
his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate .
"halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant 
swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel .

not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie .
"earlier this year 
ick . . . real
sweet stuff .
"but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer 
"i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film 
yipes . . . another
beauty .
so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ?
"uhhhm 
much .
"plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties 
"but as more and more people find out about their scheme 
"critique : simply stated 
"for a comedy 
"this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be 
"thankfully 
"and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far 
"foremost was travolta's character 
"and for me 
he didn't fit the part .
i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role .
"a cool 
"in this film 
"we're not supposed to be able to notice that 
"add that to lisa kudrow 
"michael rapaport 
"and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells 
the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me .
"i also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character 
give this dude his own movie !
"he played a lazy cop 
"he fakes injuries to get off duty 
there's a base of humor .
"sadly 
"and there's not much else i can say about this movie 
"on the whole 
but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i'm there !
the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars .
"producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars 
gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry .
"cage is legendary retired car thief 
"seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive 
"fifty cars 
poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly .
"if the cars aren't delivered in three days 
literally .
if only someone could save him .
hmmmm . . wonder
what memphis is doing ?
"in order to give the film some emotional heft 
shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away .
will he catch him ?
"there's old flame sway ( jolie ) 
will they get back together ?
"shortsighted 
will they reconnect ?
raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime .
"will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life 
can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ?
i'll bet you can .
"following the opening credits 
he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts .
"in a later scene 
"just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it 
looks like everything might turn out alright after all .
you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins .
"that's about as strong as the characterization gets 
bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand .
monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis .
or maybe it's just the cars .
"duvall trots out his ornery 
i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one .
"lindo projects a warm hearted 
"the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones 
"without saying a word 
"like a blast of nitrous oxide 
too bad his minutes onscreen are so few .
"somehow 
every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie .
there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot .
it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test .
imagine the yuks .
there's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick .
it's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk .
the ramifications are never explored .
then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars .
"not only is it stupid 
"this is a movie made of pretty 
"gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining 
first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it's been given .
"for those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on 
hopeful still ?
"well 
"butterfly ? 
"i asked myself 
and then it hit me . . .
the scene had been snipped !
"damn you 
we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! !
so . . .
no naked teri hatcher .
forget about that .
okay ?
now . . .
"heaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving 
"everything dull 
"the plane nosedives into the water and sinks 
"what they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer 
"when robicheaux discovers this 
"the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious 
"as dave robicheaux 
"no seriously 
"he's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic moments 
"three-quarters of the way through the show 
"on the other hand 
"eric roberts as bubba rocque 
"and lest we forget teri hatcher's role in all this 
"she is totally ridiculous as rocque's manipulative and seductive cajun wife 
it's probably safe to say that her day job beckons .
"and at the end of our day 
the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .

"* * * pretty good 
"* * * * amazing

see it twice .
it's amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies .
take adam sandler .
"on the basis of his first two cds ( "" they're all gonna laugh at you ! """
"and "" what the hell happened to me ? "" ) 
he's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams .
"but when you put him in front of a camera 
"i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation 
"seriously 
"in fact 
"the first half hour generated not one smile in me 
"granted 
"you're all familiar with the plot because you've seen it at least a million times before ; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions 
"and believe me 
"if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie 
the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby's love interest .
"i mean 
kudos to both of them .
"my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin 
rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh .
"or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have 
"with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses 
"according to popular film opinion 
"take for example "" casablanca . """
"great film 
it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic .
"another example would be "" star wars 
"but as i rewatched "" independence day "" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 
"i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good "" escape film . """
"but when i rewatched it 
"thus 
""" independence day "" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics

there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama .
"one scene 
"the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of "" glen or glenda ? """
"now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once 
"and "" independence day "" has no balls ."
it plays it safe everywhere .
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films .
"the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of "" star wars . """
"i mean 
"and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in "" striptease . """
"they're these octopus men 
"i mean 
"the aliens in "" 2001 "" were more interesting and you didn't even see them !"
basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful .
"okay 
"now they aren't and somehow a computer geek 
yep .
"these aliens are not only heavily armed 
"they also use the same kind of computer as we do 
"the president ( bill pullman )

"i don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol 
"later on 
i think it's time for impeachment for this guy .
he's more senile than reagan on pot .
then there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave ) .
"his girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with "" striptease "" in that she has to do it for her son ."
"come on 
i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers .
"she's also the few 
there are some bright spots .
they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing .

""" it's the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning ."
"and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he's a stereotype

it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that's what it is .
"but after a couple months 
but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime .
this one's short on batteries .
"by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer 
action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup .
"audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending 
"somewhere out there 
"i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) 
sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create .
"with expectations high ( and how could they not be 
something this bad can't help but look even worse .
"the last time a big-name 
"sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss 
"science and philosophy 
attempts at characterization fall apart .
"intelligent writing 
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness .
"but all that is just in preparation for the ending 
this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect .
i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film .
"there is some promise 
"we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) 
"when one is found in the middle of nowhere 
"on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) 
"together

"the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship

"this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension 
"additionally 
it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience .
what about that a-list cast ?
"not surprisingly 
"dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this 
sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat .
their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective .
"then there's queen latifa 
"i like to think that levinson and hoffman 
"if that's the case

it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies .
"that is

"he has the title in mind 
"then 
"there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters 
the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author .
"ironically 
"the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot 
"one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner 
"so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production 
the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth's theatres .
joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though .
he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad .
gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well .
"however 
geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking .
they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links .
"you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no 
and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well .
"but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film

i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter .
suspense ?
family drama ?
humor ?
erotica ?
"elements of each of these genres exist in the film 
"instead 
i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing .
"alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer 
"her character has absolutely no depth at all 
everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends .
the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds .
the father ( played by j . t .
walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend .
"none of these fantasy sequences

the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting .

they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail .

but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it .
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco .
the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking .
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs .
"who were the major people involved 
that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider .
"this all could have been enthralling 
"and in the end 
"to make a long story short 
the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist .
we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand .
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) .
there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it .
"this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story 
"terrorists can grab the headlines 
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home .
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly .
he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family .
rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income .
meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand .
"they offer wigand $12 
"wigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings 
he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman .
"in spite of the secrecy 
and so the game begins .
wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer .
meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family .
the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants .
wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out .
he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight .
al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider .
the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail .
the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience .
"the musical score by pieter bourke 
it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling .
also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace .
plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly .
this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director's control .
michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style .
i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
"i should have known 
"ewan mcgregor - codename : "" eye "" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat

"and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla 
there's some genuine talent involved here .
"i think at the twenty minute mark

"private investigation ? )

"when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house 
"ok 
"then she starts to cry 
for the first time .
so begins our tale of obsession . . .
or . . . something .
"the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states 
"throughout his entire professional life 
"fine 
"but gosh darn it 
and that's precisely where this film fails .
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off .
"it's an abortion 
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller .
"here 
"i never 
"the movie offers only two explanations 
"explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter 
"explanation two 
"whoo hoo 
"that's as deep as it gets 
"there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes 
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .
"my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina 
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .
"any time one of the frequent location changes occurs 
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass .
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .

"and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere 
not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .
the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .

there's no hope .
the future is bleak .
then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race .
it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise .

but it does .
the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits .
"are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold 
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ?
or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ?
or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ?
travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining .
almost .

"the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune "" ."
the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with .

"the list of the problems with "" battlefield earth "" is endless ."
it's difficult to find anything in the film that does work .
oh yeah .
the color scheme is nice .
the real question is how this movie ever got made .
could it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ?
and that john travolta is a member of the church .
that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago .
but it doesn't give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell's atrocious script was used .
or why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film .
or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems .

"oh well 
"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk 
"michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' 
"the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk 
"greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) 
"these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags 
"it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness 
"if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier 
"but 
"it's fast-paced and entertaining 
"for the first portion of this review 
wish me luck .
first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport .
"while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script 
"he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place 
another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character .
"they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican 
"it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist 
"but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things 
"enough of the charade - for the most part 
"it's stupid 
"i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater 
"action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy 
and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks .
"don't get me wrong 
"it's too bad most of them are unintentional 
the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed .
"it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber 
"coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play 
"especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown 
"things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars 
"if that's not enough for you 
their crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here .
"wait 
i'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk .
i can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that .
"i suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise 
"but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one 
"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film 
"so when miramax started production on _54_ last year 
"my 
"hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) 
"at the last minute 
"and with good reason--somehow 
boring .

what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ?
"even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_

you can thank charlie's angels -- the movie -- for that .
when did banality and pandering become okay ?

charlie's angels is dumb .
just plain dumb .
"as we all know 
"they all drive fast cars 
"and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits 
the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company .
"of course 
the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels' hair .
"the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley 
"the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc 
charlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight .
"nothing is difficult 
"it feels like the matrix 
diaz is a knucklehead .
"barrymore is the "" dangerous one 
liu is just . . .
"lucy liu 
the list of movies from which charlie's angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing .
"the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon 
"it's a shame 
"then again 
"there is no camp value in the film 
"note to hollywood : next time 
"i have always been a fan of director neil jordan 
"his latest film 
"told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy 
"his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic 
"francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say 
"the premise of 
"francis is in almost every scene 
"this is definately not young owens fault 
the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay .
"the supporting characters are no help 
"rea is wasted 
he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout .
"shaw has a little bit more to work with 
and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice .
"the pacing is all off in 
"although the story could have been dynamite 
"it is also very episodic 
"at one point 
"i'd rather think of 
"he has already proven to be a strong director 
"what could have been a courageous 
"as you should know 
"with a total of 4 decent films 
"with that said 
"the film is based on the michael crichton "" eaters of the dead "" 
"after tarveling for many months 
"so 
so far it sounds interesting right ?
not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes .
"after that 
"that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film 
obviously that's not the case here .
"even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure 
"since all the action takes place in fog 
can't the camera men sit still ?
"i'd like to actually watch a film in focus 
"the film moves on and on until the point 
"with corny dialogue 
that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest .
"when i heard that john mctiernan 
well now i know .

"numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people 
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ?
did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ?
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ?
"and just what does the film's title signify 
"as far as i can tell 
character relationships in this film also make very little sense .
"for some reason 
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes .
bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other .
"fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later 
"when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship 
"every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly

"furthermore 
"maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits 
"right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) 
"the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know 
point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing .
doesn't make sense .
"since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations 
not a whit .
"it's a shame 
they don't find it .
bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces .
sexual tension ?
more like constipation .
"maybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as "" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . """
"not that we ever find out who that is 
the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper .
"as troy 
"he' s awfully one-note 
the rest of the cast does even less .
"tunney stands around looking cute 
phillips broods .
cruz flirts with the computer .
"then they all die and a star blows up or something 
""" supernova "" is pretty awful 
that's it .

"it usually results in a bad movie 
"for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters 
i would give it one half of a star for guts .
anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts .
i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show .
the script was the worst part .
they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh .
"they had lots of "" great "" sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door ."
turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show .
the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left .
buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies .
tell them the show is great and smile a lot .

"review written on : september 29 
opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .
the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits .
"the rationale is sound 
"last year's speed 2 and scream 2 
"in some cases 
whatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller .
"julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know 
"julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie 
"will and julie hit it off 
"unfortunately 
"it's another bloody showdown 
"there's not much that's original about i still know 
"for die-hard fans of the genre 
"the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work 
the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments .
much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point .
"the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway 
"and 
"three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as "" the killer . """
"they're almost used to it 
"and so 
god help us .
i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work .
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain .
"with teaching mrs . tingle 
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here .
"the components are all there 
but where are the thrills ?
the laughs ?
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge .
and what a shame that is .
"i loved the scream films - heck 
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office .
"teaching mrs . tingle 
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties .
"i still have my faith 
"the title character of his pet project is a vicious 
mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils .
"the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her 
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way .
mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink .
"in other words 
the plot is a big problem here .
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director .
"the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann 
"but typical mrs . tingle says her history project 
"later on while studying in the gymnasium 
leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it .
"alas 
in the morning . . .
how convenient !
"the three students head to mrs . tingle's house 
"things get out of hand 
the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her .
"of course 
"besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor 
there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved .
the humor is completely inconsistent .
"after many of the jokes 
"you continue to await some momentum in the story 
a moment like that never arises .
"williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players 
"and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor 
"on the plus side 
"while everything is pretty lifeless 
"there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again 
mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching .
"she is convincingly evil and fun to watch 
"if there is one word for the movie surrounding her 
"basically 
his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) .
"we will see 
"a film that means well 
it's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past .
"the heroine is an attractive 
"her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps 
"her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything 
"he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis 
"out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment 
"the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv 
"chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules 
the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses .
"to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) 
"the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story 
"it starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity 
"the effort seemed heavy-handed 
"the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades 
"the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser 
"topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser 
"the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away 
"but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence 
"i felt i didn't just see a movie 
"it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon 
"in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage 
"that seems strange 
unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha .
"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" ."
so i didn't expect too much from this .
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .
"i thought : liam neeson 
"i thought 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .
"but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones 
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .
"here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house 
"among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) 
"actually 
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .
"it rumbles 
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs .
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .
"but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real 
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .
is that exciting or what ?
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad .
"it's based on a great book 
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .

"the music is blaring

is this part of the experiment ?
are these hallucinations ?

the answer is no .

"stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer

"while beatty gets off a few tart observations 
maybe we're supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn't initiate his own sex romps ?
keaton's ellie has a trusting nature that's a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character .

""" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . """
"-- chuck dowling 
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin .
"apparently 
"oh 
oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . .
because he's done it again .
"the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore 
"in fact 
"in the opening minutes of 8mm 
"keep this fact in mind 
"he returns home to his wife and new daughter 
he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery .
after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe .
"it appears to be snuff film 
"the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film 
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film .
the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless .
"welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald 
"when you first see him 
the choice of casting does the film in .
"then 
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet .
so your first instinct has now been confirmed .
"then 
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended .
huh ?
"also 
so why did he give it up in the first place ? !
"the lawyer had the film the whole time 
it's totally absurd . . .
and this is the screenwriter of seven ?
"late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters 
"cage 
"james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense "" ."
"you see 
go around to the other side of the car ! !
this goes on for minutes .
"then 
"boy 
"i think the final straw would be when cage returns home 
we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard .
"other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music 
"whenever the score starts up 
awful decision there joel .
another is cage's performance .
"at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances 
"for 8mm 
you're capable of much better mr . cage .
now as for you mr . schumacher . . .
i'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .
[r]
there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr .
"magoo' was by far the worst ever made 
it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie .
the film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me .
"loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit 
after escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty .
"he turns to burglary to survive 
a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down .
"he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later 
"now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back 
"a film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood 
"the film moves along at a rather slow pace 
"it opens with a fun 
"some of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse 
come on people get some new ideas already !
what's even worse is that the film has no plot at all .
"well to a certain extent it does 
'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film .
it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie .
"even with the huge cast talent 
it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller .
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may .
both those films were tense exercises in chills .
"the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man 
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively .
"for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films 
each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot .
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay .
the thrills all came from the plot .
ronin is like a film made by another man .
"somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot 
we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure .
the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai .
"when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death 
"if you miss the opening 
this film will explain again what a ronin is .
sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin .
he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer .
he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france .
"sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) 
dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case .
"sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) 
also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) .
"the group seems to know their business 
their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team .
the story is not very easy to follow .
it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom .
somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case .
some very good actors are involved in this film .
one wonders what they saw in the script .
the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers .
"they know their work 
by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody .
"maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts 
in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) .
"as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s 
"unfortunately there are no deep characters 
i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
"non-spoiler : incidentally 
also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet .
this is the first blow of the 47 ronin .
"the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project 
that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright .
he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long .
now don't think i condone this just because i'm male .
"my philosophy is 
darnell doesn't think like this .
he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them .
"and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target 
"after all 
"if he is lining up all these women 
"but he doesn't 
you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her .
( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! )
"now 
"one final flaw 
"brandi is a classy 
but all of a sudden she says yes .
"but when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions 
"lawrence can be good when he wants to 
look at this movie .
"four writers 
"there are some bright spots 
"whitfield 
"and there are some funny parts ( like 
capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness .
potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring .
"claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze 
it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e .
"movie 
means so f * * * ing earnest .
movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing .
"claire is one strained speech after another 
"claire takes two women 
"claire wrights light comedy 
"obviously 
the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness .
"the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie 
"the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance 
( ugh ! )
the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads .
"all of this 
"we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone 
the problem with claire . . .
"is not lesbianism as such 
"why is it that any "" serious "" ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ?"
"the way this movie deals with lesbianism 
"many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging 
"look at john sayles' lianna 
what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants .
"the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) 
"a truly profound statement 
"for those uninformed souls 
"urban legend is a mad slasher flick 
"for film makers 
"alas 
i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it .
it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt .
"the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills 
"unfortunately 
"if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin 
"but forget all that 
allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation .
"these flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations 
"sadly out of the literally hundreds made 
and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three .
"despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame 
"as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus 
"you see 
"all those young people are growing up together 
all the better for that elusive crazed killer .
"coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around 
"but alas 
"this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than 
"it's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey 
it's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack .
i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing .
"yes the audience jumps 
i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer .
apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers .
"in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) 
for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume .
"though i must admit 
"the film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know 
"i won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used 
"sad to say 
now that would be scary .
"before i leave you 
"only jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt 
"the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum 
ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining .
"after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can't stand getting slaughtered 
the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all .
"we've seen it before in passenger 57 
"you know 
"turbulence starts out with a "" convict "" ray liotta being accused of a crime ."
"you think there is no way he could have done it 
he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la .
this is already a problem .
there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on .

"when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions 
"it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense 
imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits .
and i was impressed .
"in fact 
"it's kiddie-porn hackwork 
"i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out 
"cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way 
"i also hate ryan phillippe 
phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont .
wow .
isn't that a memorable name ?
i could just say it over and over again .
sebastian valmont .
"it kind of rolls off the tongue 
"sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have 
"he has all the money

"sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister

overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998
"this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director 
but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead .
annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again .
"she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) 
they sacked him after he got sick .
now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation .
that actually is the whole storyline .
speed 2 could do without dialogues .
the movie is all about images and remarkable sound .
i don't really know why this is called an action movie .
except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies .
first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie .
then desaster strikes .
sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around .
"i looked for the "" action "" but couldn't find it ."
most of the time she is part of the decoration .
the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door .
now we know that she can handle a chain saw .
we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds .
"the bomb defusal of course goes wrong 
"jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie 
"his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone 
he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part .
"then there's willem dafoe 
"he doesn't succeed 
an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential .
before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror .
i can't really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny .
"especially the showdown 
there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie .
in keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death .
a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision .
some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie .
had they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them .
those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects .
in an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate .
but the ilm special effects can't save the movie .
for all the money they could have done better .
it's tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city .
"just ask mr . furious ( ben stiller ) 
"they're trying to break into the biz 
the good captain has his own problems .
"because he's all but eliminated crime 
"the public craves a major slugfest 
frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations ; he captures capt . amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city .
"so 
"the raja hurls forks at foes 
"after a painful first strike 
""" mystery men "" boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled ."
"in addition to those already mentioned 
the cast includes four oscar-nominated actors !
"when i saw the list of players early last year 
"yet 
the script is probably the worst of 1999 .
nearly every joke misfires .
the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny .
"( for example 
the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work .
"the cast tries hard 
"8mm 
"nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles 
"the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' 
all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not .
"welles agrees 
"although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema 
"the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing 
"8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much 
"the cast help towards the entertainment 
"while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) 
"here 
"and in this overlong thriller 
"only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving 
"his performance is a great break away from the gloom 
"catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife 
"her character 
also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director .
"as this film is written by the person behind seven 
"unlike seven 
"lacking the strong characters seven featured 
"but director joel schumacher 
"schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience 
"also 
"8mm is far from an success 
"with a boring lead character 
"ultimately 
"and trust me 
"your first clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : it's heavily christmas-themed and its release date is 
"your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : charlize theron

how to immediately grab my attention : open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits .
"then show a caption reading "" six days earlier . . . """
"ya know 
how to immediately lose my attention : follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene .

"kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino 
"on paper 
it's not like the man isn't capable . . .
far from it .
he's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may .
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i've ever seen in last year's ronin .
but he's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . .
put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr . moreau .
step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero .
"he gets no good one-liners 
"his name is rudy ( short for rudolph 
"see 
get it ?
get it ?
shut up . )
"in the past 
step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with .
"he's dirty and potty-mouthed 
he's also extremely inept at what he does .
"he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises 
"but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role 
"[on a side note 
"award 
last week's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ]
"how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that 
this is a bad movie .
"and what's worse is that 
"if they'd done that much 
"carry on at your convenience is all about the goings-on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer 
"once they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote ( charles hawtrey ) has designed a suitable model 
"meanwhile 
"he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore ( joan sims ) but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races 
"his daughter 
"in the end 
"also 
"there are some good performances 
charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes .
his part is mildly amusing .
"richard o'callaghan is appealing as bogg's stuck-up son 
"however 
"although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline 
a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress .
the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope .
"in his carry on debut 
joan sims returns as the love interest ( instead of barbara windsor ) .
sims' 'usual' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques .
"additionally 
this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer : - the locations and wealth of characters are appealing .
"however 
this movie does not know where it is going .
it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for 'bluer' jokes or to maintain the 'innocent' jokes success of most of its predecessors .
that is why this film suffers .
a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques .
the new 'minor-regulars' such as o'callaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while .
"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" ."
so i didn't expect too much from this .
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .
"i thought : liam neeson 
"i thought 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .
"but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones 
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .
"here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house 
"among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) 
"actually 
what happens .
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .
"it rumbles 
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs .
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .
"but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real 
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .
is that exciting or what ?
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad .
"it's based on a great book 
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .
""" the blair witch project "" 
and with a $70 mill .
"budget 
de !
"bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is 
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush .
but why give him a more serious material ?
"in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director ."
yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad .
"the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful 
but this is where the good things end .
"the music is blaring 
"it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive 
at first you do not know what's going on .
is this part of the experiment ?
are these hallucinations ?
projections of the subconscience ?
paranoia ?
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening .
the house is actually possessed .
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window .
"for ever 
"i believe hichock once said that "" it's !"
"better to wait for a climax 
"this may be true 
they are impossible to take seriously .
"any paralells that you might have heard before 
""" shining "" had class 
""" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of ."
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film .
"casting good actors for small 
"but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write 
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . '
there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .
"it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives 
"if the film looks familiar 
alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral .
"wayne wang's ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey ."
pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills .
"the daughter resents her twice divorced 
the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .
"so it becomes a question of who knows best 
"adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good 
daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .

eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .
"but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality 
"when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) 
the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .
"i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say 
"mother has a series of setbacks 
but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .
"she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do 
"this of course results in the corny ending 
this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .

exciting ?
challenging ?
"given the unprecedented popularity ( especially among teenage boys ) of the video game that sports an uber-buff

"who the heck cares ? ) and it makes "" super mario bros . "" ( bob hoskins' ill-advised career move ) look like "" rocco and his brothers "" ( that classic of italian neo-realism ) ."
i'll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there's actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper .
"this is where the jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn't about character development it's about kicking serious butt ( or bum

unsuccessful ? not entirely .
"if anything 
walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia .
"but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios 
"disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas 
"with anastasia 
some may say - so what ?
it's just a kid's movie .
well . . .
"if you have young kids 
consider yourselves warned .
"nevertheless 
"don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout 
"and yet in other scenes 
was this rushed to market to combat disney ?
"the plot 
not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened .
as for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe .
you'll see 60% of anastasia there .
"here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big 
"the obvious answer to this question is cardboard 
deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer .
"in fact 
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore .
not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions .
"we learn some bloody trivia 
"i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre 
"on the surface 
"in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors 
"the film is not humorous 
"in fact 
is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ?
"probably not 
the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship .
"in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics 
"their goal : attack a cruise ship 
"the problem is 
"aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members 
the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles .
"the cast 
"williams 
"famke janssen 
"given her limited acting abilities 
"unfortunately 
"meanwhile 
"these days 
this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn .
"the days of jurassic park 
"now 
"in deep rising 
"unfortunately 
"even once this film has sunk out of sight 
"like the slimy 
"and that consideration 
this is an adaptation of h . g . wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man' .
the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue .
the director is paul verhoven .
"that 
the problem is to keep us there .
i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time .
"working on a top secret military project 
the first two faces are completed .
"now 
caine volunteers for this risky experiment .
"but when he is made invisible 
"while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal 
but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania .
"he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers 
soon every sense of decency is forgotten .
"the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off 
"though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' 
this is a very silly production .
"laughable 
apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far .
for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected .
it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie .
"being invisible 
in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences .
the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about .
"all that 
caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man .
"but since this is a modernization 
he becomes a rapist .
"and then 
you'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place .
"shue's talent is barely seen 
kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully .
"his face is not seen for the most part of the film 
there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing .
in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place .
"being probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" 
"we observe the layers of skin 
"we see a beating heart 
"there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke 
"what is truly disturbing is that with a great book 
"pretty much like jan de bont ( "" twister "" 
"he was responsible for several good films ( "" basic instinct "" and "" starship troopers ) "" and some incredibly bad films ( "" showgirls "" 
"in a way "" hollow man "" fits perfectly in this collection ."
it's not better or worse than verhoven's average film .
he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues .
"and so 
"he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball 
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) .
and all we can ask is why ?
the answer is simple .
"though hollywood is a movie producing machine 
"it has to be about telling stories 
"it has to be about transporting us to a different place 
"to make us care 
verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that .
"it's all flesh and bones 
a void where its imagination should be .
eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights .
"as the movie's writer 
"but at the same time 
should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ?
"well 
"here's what murphy thinks : "" i think the audience is expecting a good time ."
they gonna get sexy .
they gonna get funny .
they gonna get drama .
they gonna get all of that .
"i think it's the best movie i've done "" ( paramount radio network ) ."
"here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless 
and guess who's to blame ? !
the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film .
"no 
murphy's awful script is the culprit .
let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting :
( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture .
"yes 
practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word .
"and after 15 minutes 
( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast .
"richard pryor 
"each of them shines occasionally 
( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men .
"murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life 
"but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 
you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff .
"for instance 
and he shoots jasmine guy in the head .
"this is a mean-spirited movie 
"lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore 
thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer .
( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date .
the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film .
murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality .
sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair .
( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting .
"if you're going to make another sting movie 
murphy's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula .
"( 6 ) to get laughs 
you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped .
( 7 ) murphy's idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life .
for what ?
for shooting reese's little toe off !
"needless to say 
"in all fairness 
danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take .
"aiello stands out in the large 
aiello's zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice .
"another bright spot is arsenio hall 
"in fact 
"unfortunately 
"of course 
they are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission .
because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy !
"at last 
"the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot 
bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident .
"at the same time 
"grace gets elizabeth's heart 
it's the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people .
four writers are credited with contributing to the story .
that doesn't seem possible .
"despite being a solid two hours long 
"duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks 
"since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before 
"he's out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i've always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on "" the x-files "" comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) ."
there's something about duchovny that makes me uneasy .
"regardless of the role he's playing 
"the only redeeming quality of "" return to me "" is its hilarious supporting cast ."
"the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker 
carroll o'connor is grace's grandfather marty o'reilly .
"when bob comes into marty's restaurant after hours 
"when marty discovers that bob is a widower 
"his wife is dead ! """
the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news .
also funny : bonnie hunt as grace's best friend megan and james belushi as megan's husband joe .
"married with children 
"although it's rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater 
rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob's best friend and robert loggia as marty's brother-in-law angelo .
in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast .
"bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie 
"i'm not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream 
"seriously 
the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue .
"an example : "" that [car crash] must've been awful . . . for"
"everyone involved . """
"you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said 
"i know in slasher movies there isn't supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don't mind cardboard cutouts 
"one reason movies like scream 
aside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren't on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade .
"alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill

"an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence 
"a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows 
"the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s

worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie .
there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) .
"the solitary car chase might have been a highlight 
"pepper 
he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie .
"even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history 
"on top of that debacle

"mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s ."
"mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate 
"the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing ."
"with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros . 's batman film franchise 
"in the summer of 1997 
"this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book 
what happened ?
why is spawn so bad ?
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo .
"i don't think 
"i place the blame 
"these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character 
"hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires 
"a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid 
spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level .
mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero .
"a mercenary by trade 
"having died and journeyed to hell 
"simmons 
"despite his sometimes violent nature 
spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so .
"when the characters are developed 
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters .
"spawn 
"john leguizamo 
i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator .
"the film 
"apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) 
"leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role 
"michael jai white 
more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings .
"a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top 
"easily the hammiest performance in the movie 
sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film .
many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down .
"mtv-style

"cogliostro 
"he goofily tells the audience

"for forty minutes or so

"red's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper 
"enter jjaks ( keanu reeves )

"it does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life 
"the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments 
"most important 
you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota .
"unfortunately 
"i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding 
"what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality 
"suddenly 
"the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another 
"vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam 
"there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) 
"i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop 
"it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value

"it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit

not nearly enough .

"it is not the all-star cast's fault 
"allen payne's character never speaks in the entire movie 
are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ?
"fichtner's character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know what he's doing there 
"the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene "" you know what would look good on you ?"

"as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters 
only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk .
the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real .
"i can only imagine if this was an imax film 
"this is loud 
the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment .
the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so .

"synopsis : valerie 
"after a jailbreak 
"comments : "" alan smithee "" directed fatal charm 
"if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by "" alan smithee 
""" alan smithee "" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad ."
"frankly 
where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ?
let's start with the acting .
it's pretty bad .
"amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) 
she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete .
"her scenes with valerie's mother 
"the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together 
"christopher atkins 
"trying to appear malicious and dangerous 
"if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber 
"early on in the movie 
"outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers 
they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever .
"fatal charm's storyline 
"the script belabors a red herring 
"this suspect 
"even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed 
"so 
"the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an "" erotic thriller "" ."
"a thriller it isn't 
"i can't imagine 
"a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see 
"on a personal note 
it's no wonder why she hated high school so much .
"as an instructor of english myself 
i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students .
"fatal charm won't charm anyone 
"if you happen upon this turkey 
"a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature 
"well 
"anyhow 
"the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated 
"no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies 
the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist .
"the captain of the tug 
"to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields 
"some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific 
none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .
"this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story 
all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .
the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .
"it looks genuinely fake 
"also on the topic of flaws 
"if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics 
"regardless 
"as to the actual casting for the movie 
"the actors were superb 
having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .
"watching these actors act this story out made it bearable 
the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .
so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed .
"as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens 
this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .
this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name .
"before this film 
but the idea of doing a movie is insane .
"it should have been animated 
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast .
yet it still fails .
the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that .
the story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company .
"eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis 
"so 
they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper ) .
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in .
the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves .
the acting is ok .
this seems to be more of a visual film .
"the special effects are good 
however the film drags and is no fun .
"and it leaves itself open to a sequel 
"this movie begins sort of promising 
"so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper 
the movie .
you could do worse .
but you could definitely do better . . .

street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van-damme
this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 . it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot .
"it is more like a "" movie "" than it should be ."
"yes 
"raul julia does a good job 
"while the game had non-stop fighting sequences 
does it work ?
sort of . . .
the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m . bison ( raul julia ) .
guile ( jean claude van-damme ) takes his troops to attack bison's main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over .
"in a short amount of time 
it catches your attention .
"but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like "" there's chun li ! ! """
"or "" look at that fire-ball ryu did at vega "" ."
"it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets 
this movie needed more action in the first place .
the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting .
"if you like light-hearted action flicks 
"it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia's last performance

"first time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer 
"his story is trite and shallow

"the victims are headless 
"now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy 
"sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character 
"in the original 
"no one could stop him 
"by the end of the film 
"burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere 
"he takes no risk what so ever 
another pathetic element of the film was the script .
"like i said earlier 
he completely butchered the story to pieces .
thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked .
the acting by depp was quite notable .
"he took the nerdy character of the cartoon 
"if it wasn't for his quirky one-liners 
"just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress 
it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster .
"it's too tempting to let go 
the atmosphere too was quite involving .
"i should have just gazed at the sets 
"at least burton's films are eye candy 
"the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads

"by the end 
"this is the biggest disappointment of the year

i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world .
and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it .
"writer/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) 
"convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant 
"his wife's sister rachel ( "" friends "" ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) 
thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion .
"taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic 
"composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds 
"the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought 
the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot .
it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth .
"corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has 
only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve .
"even she can't force taplitz to decide whose story this is 
"by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film 
commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously .
the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment .

it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot .

"at this point 
"but then 
"the film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting 
"in the film 
"as the manipulative clique leader 
it's a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . )
jawbreaker doesn't quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie .

- evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of .
- gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible .
"nice miniature effects 
- has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi-chi the leopard .
- several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim .

`the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see .
"wading through this gooey 
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy .
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money .
"although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon 
"most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films 
can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ?
"perhaps 
but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements .
the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success .
"a few instances of adorable humor aside 
"o'donnell plays jimmie 
"jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals 
the problem is that his proposal sucks .
big time .
"you can tell things aren't going pleasantly 
"and then 
"jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly 
everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie .
"of course 
the bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day .
"with anne out of town 
and within a very limited time frame .
there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor' .
"for one 
another is the colorful cast .
"o'donnell and zellweger are cute together 
"ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure 
"and now the cons : the approach may be interesting 
"the characters are drawn with obvious 
"yes 
"the screenplay is lamely written 
"the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted 
"potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach 
`the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it .
"you've seen the tv spots

"in actuality 
"after seeing the movie 
"o'donnell could be running from his angry fans

it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other .
"there is liz 
"for the first hour 
the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them .
"at times 
"this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - "" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related "" - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing ."
unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained .
"with about half an hour to go 
such a disappointment after such a brilliant start .
the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive .
the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable .
a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film .
it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles .
that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock .
"up till that point 
"while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility 
"not just the events 
this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film .
"as stated above 
it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss .
beware of movies with the director's name in the title .
"take "" john carpenter's ghosts of mars "" ( please ) ."
"if the carpenter brand name wasn't superglued to the title 
and i would have been spared a headache .
"the latest from the director of "" starman 
"the production is set on mars in 2176 
"six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the red planet 
a matriarchal society .
terra-forming .
"sounds pretty intriguing 
"well 
"august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children's films 
"last year 
parents will be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did .
"don't get me wrong - keeble 
"in fact 
"but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy 
"we first see young max keeble ( alex d . linz 
"the scenario is 
"max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude 
things don't get any better for max when he arrives at school .
"he has to contend with 
"when max's father ( grownup nerd robert carradine ) unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week 
"whoa - don't worry 
he doesn't do it klebold-harris style .
"it's all pretty tame stuff 
"director tim hill ( muppets from space ) adds a few nice touches 
"you count some farting 
1 : 30 - pg for some bullying and crude humor
the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . .
"and 
"naturally 
the movie .
"when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at 
"if you've glanced at a poster for this movie 
"well 
"event horizon is a mean-spirited 
"it starts off as an alien rip-off 
at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien .
"that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie 
"it not a scary monster movie 
it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore .
you've seen this kind of movie before .
the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility .
"this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect 
"it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore 
"there are many good 
"paul anderson's direction is impressive 
"there are many nice special effects 
the sets are beautiful to gaze upon .
and richard t . jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has .
and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film .
"the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls 
a haunted house story in space isn't such a bad idea .
but the final execution is extremely disappointing .
that's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn't have talent .
"for those first 40 minutes 
"he even has one scene that 
"he definitely has something of a gift 
"i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him 
"but because of what this movie degenerates into 
"if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film 
there is a rule when it comes to movies .
a sequel is never as good as the original .
"there are very few exceptions to this rule 
"now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie 
don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) .
they made this movie before they were stars .
judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons .
it's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey .
"apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was 
apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day .
"and i don't blame them 
unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character .
while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control .
"( hey 
"to make matters worse 
there is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth mentioning .
let's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick .
"man 
this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities .
even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds .
"the writing is bad 
this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch .
"a guarantee you 
"as a hot-shot defense attorney 
"he is also an excellent judge of character 
"and 
"in the opening scene 
"his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country 
"he is brought to their headquarters in nyc 
lomax is soon given the case of his life .
he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide .
the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell .
"he works late 
but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story .
"it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big 
but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm .
"quite literally 
"freaky and frightening things begin to happen 
the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts .
the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer .
the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax .
"unfortunately 
"granted 
you'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino .
you'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties .
"you'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann 
"this was one of the better storylines 
"as with all thing's involving the devil 
"in the first few scenes 
his path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored .
"his actions seem arbitrary 
"pacino's comical portrayal is spirited 
"there is another plot or two that is introduced 
"the focus seemed inconsistent throughout 
"this movie tries to be horrifying 
"however 
"i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick 
"however 
i didn't like it .
"if i had to summarize this film 
"that's the kernel of it 
"tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women 
"unfortunately 
"actually 
"they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy 
"they laughed 
"three women ( cher 
"one night 
"in seeming answer to their idle daydreams 
"he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power 
"even worse 
"anyway 
"we never get inside them 
"as for nicholson 
and then there's the special effects .
not in themselves--they weren't that good--but their overuse .
"i was almost positive 
"nope 
"f'gawds sake 
let him loose !
let him grin demonically !
skip the splitting earth and fake lightning !
"watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll 
"if you're going to use slapstick like that 
"nicholson does what he can with the role 
and no wonder .
"this script goes all over the map 
so what is the witches of eastwick ?
a horror movie ?
a folk tale ?
a comedy ?
a statement about women ?
an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ?
i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching
"someone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms 
"in other words 
( $2 . 00 )
if you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others .
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes .
"alas 
"as it turns out 
"after all 
but the human race doesn't have much to worry about .
"after all

"virus is a truly dumb action thriller 
"when considering the entire film 
"it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens 
i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative .
virus takes itself seriously .
"and 
but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out .
"okay 
"they need to make themselves physical 
"on the ship 
"after that 
"the leader 
"every film like this has a big creature at the end 
"virus is indeed a cliched film 
"it's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it 
"on one level 
"it's really gory 
"there's also a nice array of actors 
"the bottom line 
it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing .
"in that order 
"an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature 
"where the original had comedy 
"where the first installment had chills 
"in short 
"the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) 
"soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) 
"she jumps 
"serafine disappears 
"however 
"she's a werewolf 
actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie .
"she imbues serafine with spirit 
"this isn't necessarily a good thing 
delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her .
delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise .
"she was radiant 
"given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here 
"it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris 
"and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff 
"the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say 
tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie .
it would be kind to call him bland .
"actors vince vieluf and phil buckman 
julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat .
and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal .
"on the technical side 
the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal .
the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits .
"repeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" 
and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to .

"depending on who you ask 
"but in case you didn't know this 
"the words "" original sin "" never come up in the movie of the same name

"we see boy go whore-chasing 
"but as soon as boy actually finds girl 
"girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past 
"add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) 
"don't even bother with original sin 
"just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block 
this is sacrilege .

this is just as well .
the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them .
"they're either silly

"an example is when avatar nonchalantly says 
"not very formidable when he's also the guy who says 
my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil .
"her response is 
"we just have love . """
"suffice to say 
which it does .
"the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out 
please note that it is the action that is unexpected .
that it is disappointing is not .
the film couldn't settle on a particular mood .
it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle .
scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity .
"the dramatics 
"ralph bakshi 
so who doesn't know this already ?
"well 
"okay 
it's not .
"in the scenes where good fights evil 
so is the film for adults ?
"if so 
why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ?
"wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes 
"however 
"we see no atrocities being committed 
"there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich 
"this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made

underwater science fiction stays submerged
sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents .
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered .
psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash .
"when he arrives at the site 
"having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact 
"his group as outlined in his report 
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team .
""" after all 
"lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) 
"once there they stroll over 
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere .
"when adams enters the sphere 
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer .
""" my name is jerry ."
"i am happy "" flashes across the screen ."
this is unsettling for the psychologist .
""" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks ."
barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry .
then the situation turns bad .
deadly beasts appear from nowhere .
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel .
lethal sea snakes attack goodman .
"a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 
the suspicious scientists turn against each other .
this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film .
however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product .
director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes .
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification .
it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances .
it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin .
"while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles 
oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them .
"after adams experiences the interior of the sphere 
their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited .
even goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing .
her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing .
"there's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending 
"when an emergency mini-sub is explained 
the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting .
chapter headings that divide the movie have no function .
the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos .
much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow .
"although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable 
even a science fiction film must be internally consistent .
there's too much here that doesn't make sense .
are the manifestations real ?
"the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost 
"a scene in the sub suggests that it's illusion 
"not everything has to be explained to death 
"where the ship came from is clarified 
even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll .
the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale .
"after pre-release audience testing 
it's difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse .
"following the recent tradition of lengthy films 
"the weak scenes could have been cut 
"the movie was supposedly held up by effects work 
we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm .
"stealing from "" alien "" 
"remarkably levinson and hoffman's other currently showing film is "" wag the dog "" 
this one could have been titled the same sans one word .
"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman 
"tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels 
"writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison 
"van damme plays marcus ray 
"it's all part of some type of ransom scheme 
. . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ .
"while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs 
"a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! """
"and "" entrepreneurship 
standing out among my favorites .
but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs .
"van damme is true to laughable form 
"early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) 
even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug .
"paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon 
"in rochon's defense 
"tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ 
"here 
"for each nifty trick tsui pulls off 
this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context .
"for instance 
"as he puts his hand in 
"it's undoubtedly an interesting visual 
"the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences 
"tsui does what he can to make something of them 
"there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ 
"if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success 
before it's too late .
"if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ 
"that is 
"upon first viewing of this movie 
"spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films 
"stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry 
"what little plot there is involves dick steele 
agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith .
"along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) 
"the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny 
"spy hard achieves neither 
"the "" dick 
what is it ?
"well 
"( i'm paraphrasing ) "" type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film 
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue .
"director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen 
"the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over 
"as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard 
"one of the more amusing was 
"t . kirk "" ."
"overall 
"while all of the right films to spoof were chosen 
"next time they should "" spy "" a little bit harder ."

nothing much special .

"first impressions : critically 
a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring .
an orginal plot that grows old real fast .
one of the only 90 minute films that i've gotten bored through .
men in black has defied the odds .
"when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long 
"however 
"tommy lee jones and will smith play two "" government "" agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society ."
"the ridiculous plot begins when an alien "" bug "" 
"anyway 
"the premise is ridulous 
i love original plots .
this one had an original one .
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films .
"whenever i saw d'onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film 
"while smith's wise-cracks did fill in the gaps 
"and also 
"and here i see jones 
a sentimental moment in an alien movie ?
"nice try 
it doesn't work here .
"it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don't only have aliens to worry about 
"i came into the movie not wanting to see jones's conscience 
maybe it's unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were .
"nevertheless 
there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it .
then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes .
writer-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category .
"weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters 
hitmen lee ( james spader ) and his partner dosmo ( danny aiello ) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox ( teri hatcher ) lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked .
"an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops 
"a murder is not vice territory 
"meanwhile 
"but before he can do that 
"enter nurse audrey ( marsha mason ) 
"stuffy art dealer 
"while struggling about his fancy house 
don't be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on .
you might like that feeling of cluelessness .
herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes .
the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't stunning by any means though .
"the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman's real-life heroes in short cuts 
"funny 
the tie-up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of ( director's name ?
guy who also did last seduction ) red rock west .
two days isn't a bad movie but there isn't much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters .
it'll keep you guessing alright but you won't remember the answers five minutes after the credits .
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .
"* * a little creaky 
"* * * pretty good

robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child .
of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new .

"the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend 
"comments : virtual seduction 
"both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days 
"interestingly 
this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction .
it's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality .
"unfortunately 
virtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) .
"the film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first 
many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly .
"the cast 
"jeff fahey 
"carrie genzel plays paris 
"meschach taylor 
virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background .
"in other words 
"the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre 
"this turkey 
don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch .
"yeah

"right off the bat

"pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians 
"yes 
"sound like a good 
"yes 
"in fact 
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time .
"by the time the movie finishes 
"unfortunately 
this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been .
"the 113 minutes fly by 
"the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas 
"and it's not just campbell 
"dillon 
"in fact 
that's how cheezy it comes off .
"but aside from these two 
"in the right hands 
and what's up with these people passing as high school students ?
"i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles 
i won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure .
"as corny as it is 
"but if you just want to admire denise richards 
"of course 
perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters .
i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws .
"but if you ask me 
"or more the point 
"this is not an insult to gere 
"if a film is solely about one person 
"although geres performance is in no way poorly acted 
"this is where he truly belongs 
"in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore 
"it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed 
"it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady 
"yet instead of a hangover 
he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison .
"his cell 
"now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy 
jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family . 
"as the plot thickens 
"red corner is one of those films where you sneer 
what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act .
this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption .
but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch .
"if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly 
"it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing 
"if that wasnt bad enough 
"shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father 
"taking itself far too seriously 
"although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast 
"whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor

"the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri 
"along the way 
"they rob numerous banks with identical interiors 
the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card .
the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell .
"after a great job in tigerland 
and his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal .
"combined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years

capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems .

jalla ! jalla !
is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen .
it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love .
"the film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park . roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely 
"they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park 
"roro and mans each have girlfriends 
"roro ( nicknamed "" jalla "" ) is having family problems ."
"it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman 
"yasmin likes roro 
mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence .
the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other .
mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers .
the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them .
"roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other 
not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected .
the plot turns in several places are contrived .
one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen .
lebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer .
"when things start to get slow 
for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film .
characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function .
we do see some of roro's family life and his concerns .
that may be because roro's background is a lot like that of the director .
"while the story was entertaining 
it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life .

"mcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie

how come he didn't get it ?
the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion .

"when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission 
what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected ) .

"dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day 
"films like 2001 : a space odyssey 
"there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon

"ennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on

retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 )
a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson
"i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as "" dim-witted "" ."
"and by golly 
"although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career 
"two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss 
"and like most cinematic failures 
"the story starts in new york when 
"for reasons we won't go into here 
"the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance 
that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ?
and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ?
"anyway 
"fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again 
"the dialogue 
"not bad in the quotable sense 
"mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute 
and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses .
"christopher george's performance is salvageable 
"in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead 
"as a director 
"he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes 
"and despite some gruesome violence 
"long-time collaborator fabio frizzi 
"fulci's other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery 
for completists only .
you know the plot : a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be double-crossed by a fatal femme .
"in "" palmetto 
"enter la femme : rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) 
"she and her stepdaughter odette ( chlo ? sevigny ) have a plot to extort 500k from the old man : harry will "" kidnap "" odette ."
"after groping both women 
"as everyone except harry can see 
"sure enough 
"his brother-in-law ( tom wright ) 
"there are several plot twists 
"apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog 
shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery's wolf to show up .
"her incredible performance in "" leaving las vegas "" seems to have been a fluke ."
"here 
shue's character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off as a brainless bimbo .
"in addition to shue and sevigny 
"the parts are so overplayed that with a little push "" palmetto "" could have been an over-the-top parody of film noir a la "" romeo is bleeding . """
"as it is 
""" palmetto "" has a well-known director 
"i suppose he must have been drawn to this plot-by-numbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake "" cape fear . """
schl ? ndorff tries hard-he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugs-but nothing can freshen up this stale script .
the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright .
"directed by tony scott ( top gun ) 
and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble .
jeez .
"after a great opening 
"they hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) 
"that's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier 
"the action in armageddon are so over the top 
i was not alone .
"plus 
the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots .
the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact .
producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon .
"years ago 
"the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ 
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery .
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten .
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios .
"i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ 
"_what dreams may come_ 
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized .
"it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm 
"it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences 
"robin williams plays chris nielsen 
"the director 
big mistake .
"it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) 
"instead 
it doesn't .
"so in the afterlife 
hmm . . .
i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative .
"( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me 
"that said 
read on . . .
chris' wife commits suicide .
"since suicides go to hell 
"the important question is 
good question .
and i like good thought-provoking questions .
i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question .
"i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film 
"i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic 
hey chris : did you forget ?
your thoughts are _real_ .
"they are more _real_ than the physical world 
"so 
"and then she would appear before you 
"because there would be no movie 
"and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding 
umm . . .
"if your thoughts are more real than the physical 
surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that .
"and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person 
all due respect .
"another idea 
"so chris 
you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out .
"and forcing her to write "" i still exist "" in her diary 
"there are many other ideas 
"the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before 
"most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects 
"and when this happens 
_gag me with a spoon_ .
"so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance 
"please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals 
"it sounds like a joke 
"my vote goes to a rare cd called "" never say die "" ( 1981 ) from petra 
"it+s pretty good 
( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) .
"melancholic 
"depressing 
but far more entertaining . . .
"so 
suicide--bad .
_don+t do it_ .
no . no . no . ( got it ? --you
shouldn+t have to pay $7 . 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest . )
"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 
"being a surprise commercial and critical success 
"thus 
"plush dolls 
too late .
"this is a sad review to write 
"i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic 
"consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity 
"imagine with me 
( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals .
( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy .
( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute .
"( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too 
"( 5 ) there must be action 
"that'll do . """
"now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell 
"( b ) christine cavanaugh 
out .
e . g .
daily comes in with noticable results .
"( c ) george miller 
"( d ) the special effects are impressive 
"babe talks 
"( babe is center screen 
"season now with the "" original "" elements 
"( i ) change the venue into "" the big city "" ."
this has been praised as wildly original .
excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ?
how about the muppets ?
even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo .
sorry .
no dice .
"side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look 
"but this too is over-used 
"and 
"( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell 
s-t-r-e-t-c-h .
"she's not a lead actress-type 
( have her arrested falsely on drug charges !
have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes !
have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! )
"i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes 
"i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film 
"even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it 
"no . . . my problem is with the story 
"_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm 
"being a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice 
"without giving the ending away 
"speaking of "" pig "" 
"the word "" pig "" is so overused

"further 
"had it been a cartoon 
but to farmer hoggett ?
his wife ?
an elderly mickey rooney ?
much too irreverent .
"( "" quick !"
"splice those singing mice into those scenes ! "" ) ."
the film isn't a colossal failure .
i did like glenne headley's schmoozy chimpanzee .
i liked the pink poodle .
"the dog on the cart 
and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly-cast as an airport employee and a judge .
"but most of the time 
"them singing mice 
"let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett looks at pig 
"that'll do . """
that's it .
hope i didn't ruin it for you .
but tell me this : what the heck did that pig _do_ ?
"at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer 
now my view has completely changed .
"it's time to embrace for impact 
"the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) 
"they meet fans who dress up in costumes 
"of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties 
thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians .
"the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode 
"i don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof 
all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series .
"one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space 
"creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea 
a person can only take so much .
"we do not need to be tortured 
it's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful .
"it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him 
"speaking of acting 
"sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage 
it's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage .
it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is .
alan rickman however was not so lucky .
after his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess .
it's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away .
"when the film couldn't get any worse 
"like many big blockbusters ( armageddon 
"times it works 
when will it stop ?
i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash .
"it may look fine and dandy 
is that too much to ask ?
obviously it is .
"when galaxy quest finally ends 
"aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic 
"it's not the least bit fun 
the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond .
"the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation 
"both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts 
"in panel-sized morsels 
"spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) 
"though the movie skimps on the next few plot points 
"he is renamed 
"but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child 
"typical of summer blockbusters 
"while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) 
"but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife 
"so many questions are left unanswered 
"while last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) 
"spawn is an in-your-face 
"phaedra cinema 
""" the sculptress "" is a scary proposition all right 
"from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger

"when he's not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment

i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .
retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year .
"earlier this may 
"and now 
"starring milla jovovich 
"besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich 
"at first 
"after seeing the rousing trailer 
"with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance 
a timeless epic it is not .
"besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style 
"on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction 
there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) .
jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective .
jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard .
she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast .
"jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power 
"quite frankly 
"the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy 
"faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law 
"all three actors juggle limited screen time 
"the battle scenes are extremely bloody 
"there's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on 
even his fellow troopers are petrified .
`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story .
"almost too 90's 
there's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! '
sprinkled throughout the screenplay .
"i was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib 
"there's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor 
"it seems terribly misplaced 
"the musical score by erric serra is spectacular 
"if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for 
"but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial 
"during these moments 
"it's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation 
`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf .
anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film .
"despite my original hopefulness

violence is ugly .
violence breeds yet more violence .

"there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members

review by : geoff berkshire
i'm not an overly cynical guy .
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years .
"however 
"this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle 
"the story 
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean .
"the letter 
"upon her return 
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down .
he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing .
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship .
"of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter 
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened .
the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film .
"there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother 
"a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die 
"the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced 
"well 
message in a bottle is one slow moving film .
last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this .
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work .
"message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way 
"costner and 
they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry .
the supporting players are given very little to do .
the reliable douglas is particularly wasted .
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film .
a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played .
"however 
the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story .
"gabriel yared 
caleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful .
do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ?
the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times .
the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego .
"working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) 
its strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) .
there simply isn't an original scene in this film .
the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking .
"this is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) 
he's simply going through the motions with this .
message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade .
disconnect the phone line .
don't accept the charges .

"the movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence

"jennifer jason leigh and jude law 
the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category .
"it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence 
which is actually quite good .
existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times .

even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws .
perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage .
a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy .
"meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact 
greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her .
he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding .
from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner ) .
"through no fault of his own 
and he has to ask to borrow clothing .
it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down .
as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes .
"greg is playing a game he does not understand 
but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law .
this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship .
it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films .
but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived .
too many coincidences in the story work against greg .
the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky .
"certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could 
there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy .
certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written .
the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance .
deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can .
the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities .
but we do not really see much of that digging .
ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen .
it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen .
but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that .
randy newman has written a playful score .
in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before .
there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s .
presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody's imagination .
humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment .
but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me .
i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ?
isn't there a law or something ?
this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst .
mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison .
writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill .
"the plot 
"deciding to check out the long-abandoned house 
"but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse 
the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe .
"whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue 
"the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : "" i hate that mouse "" ."
oh cringe !

one touching scene early on is worth mentioning .
we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall .
"he jumps into a tiny bed 
it's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film .
"a message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility 
this kind of rubbish will just not do at all .

"every scene swells with grand 
"take 
"we don't know patch yet 
"later on 
"and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) 
but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions .
real drama is character-based .
"you grow to like someone 
we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness .
"real drama doesn't seem forced 
that's why patch adams is not real drama .
"it goes for every cheap tear imaginable 
even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score .
sentimentality like this is indeed bad .
"but it's not as bad as half-baked 
"you see 
"he aces his tests without studying 
but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor .
""" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds ."
"well 
not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort .
most of us have to study .
"and a doctor who really wants to help 
"oh wait 
yes !
that is true !
and you can not do that without studying .
you can not do that without going to medical school .
"what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe 
follow the rules ?
bah !
who needs the rules !
only uptight doctors follow the rules .
the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants .
"and then there's the free clinic issue 
a free clinic .
in the middle of the forest .
where patients can be taken to be helped .
for free .
how will patients be transported to the free clinic ?
will it have an emergency room ?
or is it just for mental patients ?
"and who 
"the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it

"actually 
"he shouts a lot about helping people

"this finds nba players like greg ostertag 
"perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines 
"steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming 
perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while .
"among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump 
and those are the real jokes in eddie .
"nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice 
"or "" hey 
it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right .

"now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later

"fight club is either garbage or brilliant

"first is 
not even from the first film was batman really the 'star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway .

i can't really say if clooney ( who regardless was better than kilmer ) was a very good batman or not .
"he's given next to nothing to do at all

"yet his bright neon

"it'll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really 
"schwarzenegger is awful 
and this is coming from a regular fan of his work .
i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them .
he talks all to often in this movie .
i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll .
i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film .
i liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot .
"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor 
"like everyone else 
"consequently 
"let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) 
"the best word to describe this film is "" asinine . """
"the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes 
"krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany 
the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist .
"the second is that viewers should be able to identify with 
"finally 
"once upon a time 
"he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a "" lost tribe "" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea 
"shortly after their return from the failed trip 
"now 
"when he arrives at the college for the momentous event 
"to provide video footage 
"soon 
but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud .
the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt .
"unfortunately 
director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags .
"meanwhile 
the acting in underwhelming .
"dreyfuss has definitely not given his "" all "" to the role of james krippendorf ."
"alongside him 
"this quality 
"no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin 
"i know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of titanic 
most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set .
"if there's any upside 
krippendorf's tribe will quickly become extinct .
"movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting

"the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) 
i couldn't stand any of those characters .
"whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming "" yo 
all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film .
"apparently 
"in all honesty 
"and when i say "" forced "" 
they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange .
this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour .
"for instance 
"for some reason 
if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny .
"way of the gun is brimming with surprises 
one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance .
"after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer 
it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate .
"but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how 
"here 
"it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass 
"unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games 
"as for the plot 
the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed .
but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit .
"directed by christopher mcquarrie 
"unlike phillipe 
"the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s 
it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life .
"even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life 
"usual suspects 
"nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur 
"thus 
however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason .
or substance .
"it's just as overplotted as suspects 
"even the good stuff 
"at one point caan laments "" need is the ultimate monkey "" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said "" love is like hippo ass "" ."
i've seen porno with better dialogue .
and some with better plot lines too .
"but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean 
"caan slips into this role with seeming ease 
"benicio del torro is always welcome 
"speaking of pitt 
"nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey 
"taye diggs has a similar function 
for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns .
"it's vaguely tarantino-ish 
you know the routine .
the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at .
but those gun shots sure crack like thunder .

he's at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) .
"when he's in full nice-guy mode 
the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) .
but none of them work well at all .
buscemi's role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous .

"although events start of normal 
"although an interesting premise 
the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise .
"most of the dialogue is ad-libbed 
"the 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches 
"there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur 
"if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods 
"but no 
"the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting

there's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things .
"the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment 
"the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this 
"also 
"there are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged 
"the blair witch project 
"i suppose if you've been lost camping before

"the spook scenes are short and far between 
"although a good idea 
it's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com
) is better than the film .
the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done .
"one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 
"under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer ."
"the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail 
"in any event 
"almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter 
everyone salutes .
"it looked impressive 
"that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research 
"in fact 
"what results is a film that looks good 
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example .
"paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division 
"prior to the transaction 
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers ) .
"brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter 
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder .
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary .
"it gives no insight into brenner 
does the arms subplot turn up later ?
"no 
the answer : it looked cool .
"or how about the "" atmosphere "" ?"
"the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees 
"nice immersion in the setting 
"no attention is paid to the location of the story 
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ?
"instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film 
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie .
"as i've already mentioned 
"brenner 
"he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter 
"sunhill 
"both characters are protagonists 
"i could imagine that during filming 
"i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good 
"an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide 
i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention .
"a far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" 
a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear .
"the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods 
"woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds 
"hutton just kind of hangs around 
"i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based 
"the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space 
"every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case 
"instead 
"the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill 
would've been over in a half hour .
"the film finishes with a sort of bookend 
"literally during the closing credits 
they both seem kind of happy .
maybe they were driving away from simon west .
"i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting 
"in the case of the general's daughter 
"but at this juncture in the story 
"this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving 
"get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent 
"travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner 
it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) .
let the investigation begin .
"with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) 
"things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) 
"woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority 
"with echoes of his supporting role in true crime

"there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter

"it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless 
"a few brief action scenes 
"from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts

the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast .
"the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell 
"madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while 
one of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable .

"the script even unwillingly points him out for us 
"in all fairness 
"the secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually 
"the general's daughter is not a terrible movie 
but it just could have been so much better .
at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong .
"but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers 
"that's "" dirty work "" in a nutshell ."
a very different kind of movie .
this is not a movie that i can easily review .
"the critic in me analyzes the structure 
.
. and
tells me this movie is terrible .
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing .
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie .
it's a one note concept .
mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients .
"realizing they are very good at revenge plots 
first the critic in me .
"the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device 
here's the catch .
none of the characters are sympathetic .
they're all selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want .
"the jokes are juvenile 
"there's jokes about prostitutes 
"there's even a subplot that's developed 
and i loved watching it .
"i was a huge fan of norm macdonald's sarcastic 
"norm macdonald takes a joke 
like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job .
"the foreman goes over the basics 
how do they get out of it ?
"by admiting they lied on their resumes 
"and surprise 
the characters are incredibly mean-spirited .
"there's a father who's loud and obnoxious 
"the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky 
"and then there's mitch and sam 
""" too bad we have to do it 
"here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up 
"at least the film is honest 
"but at least it isn't dull 
and that's the way it should be .
"it's sketch comedy 
"the jokes are crude

"the plot centers around the return of dr . evil 
"austin must go after him 
i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original .
but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews .
i wish i had stuck to my first impression .
myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation .
"and he has the talent to do it 
"but the material he is working with here 
"this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces 
"after some of these scenes 
the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor .
"for the most part 
there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety .
"the director just throws the material at us 
"i am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd 
"certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in your face 
"if you see the film and you find you're not laughing 
it just means you grew up since seventh grade .

"phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young 
"he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) 
he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender .

.
"you expected more 
there isn't .
the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it's climax ( isn't that an apt word for studio 54 ) lands with a thud .
the glitz of the club and perpetually semi-clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it's glamour .
"for much of its target audience 
this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote .
"you can be sure that half of the audience hasn't heard of them 
"the humor 
"the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high 
he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive .
"he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued 
"it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on "" coffee talk "" sans dress and wig ."
"the supporting cast of salma hayek 
"the romance between phillippe and cambell 
the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes .
"hayek's wanna-be singer seems extremely forced and her husband 
the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long .
"overall 
"the film never leads to anything 
"in truth 
"you know 
"while watching instinct 
"even beside the tarzan comparison 
"it's painfully idealistic 
"i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore 
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved .
"i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct 
"things start off in the predictable way 
"caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life 
"the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) 
"powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa 
"through a series of short sessions 
"even though it really is an old man version of tarzan 
"as i said 
the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action .
"gooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins 
"the screenplay 
"nonetheless 
"unfortunately 
"turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure 
"first 
"the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case 
there's also the prison guard subplot .
"the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision 
"then there's the daughter subplot 
"if some of this stuff sounds familiar 
the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here .
the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had .
ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption .
hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs .
"and then there's the whole tarzan thing 
perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth .
"the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are "" takers 
"i can sympathize with that 
"this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates 
what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ?
"if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor 
"if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise 
"in the finale of disney's "" mighty joe young 
"upon impact 
"ok 
"1949's "" mighty joe young "" was an update of that classic creature feature 
"now some 49 years later 
not so .
the only--and i mean only--reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects .
"and these 
"today's joe young is designed and produced by special-effects whiz rick baker 
"joe is a combination of animatronic effects 
"while there are occasional flashes of brilliance--baker's had a lot of practice with simian effects 
"one of the film's most embarrassing moments is when paxton's band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger-than-life primate ( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from "" the lost world : jurassic park "" ) ."
"paxton jubilantly extols the beast's majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe 
"also 
even joe seems distracted at times .
"the film piles on the clich ? s like there's no tomorrow 
"kids raised on "" men in black "" ( non-monkey effects also by baker ) are going to find ron ( "" tremors "" ) underwood's outing a little lame by comparison ."

"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels 
the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel .
so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel .
"congo failed 
it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good .
"the film is expensive 
several years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered .
"the plan he wrote was only semi-serious 
now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s .
suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft .
"included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) 
together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets .
one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship .
what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances .
director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects .
the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film .
"it has some effects 
the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting .
that could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film .
but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster .
"it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put 
hoffman's acting seems muted .
jackson seems to laid back .
we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads .
levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance .
and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a
cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price .
look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors .
most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects .
"levinson tries second-tier effects 
perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium .
the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
american pie 2 is filled with laughs .
but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater .

"above and beyond the sick factor

"14 years ago 
"in 1983 
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured .
"two years later 
"now 
they've been cremated .
"vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold 
the premise is basically the same .
"clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation 
"his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around 
"of course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) 
there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it .
it's really just a skit movie .
"there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie 
"the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours 
"the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits 
vegas vacation comes off like the first .
a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep .
"the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast 
"in these cases 
"have a good vegas joke 
such is the case with this movie's mini-plots .
"clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold's money 
the simple fact is : this movie isn't funny .
"at first 
chase plays clark griswold really well .
he made the character and he is the character .
"d'angelo 
"as for the two new griswold kids 
"the "" vacation "" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters 
"they're so generic 
vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor .
"yes 
"first off 
"i couldn't find any reasons why 
"that's saying a lot 
there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact .
"the first three films in the "" vacation "" series were written by john hughes 
"mom 
wowzers !
what a r ? sum ? !
"looking at the names 
well that's not all .
"this guy also brought us 90's hits including the home alone series 
"vegas vacation 
"this time around 
"vegas vacation plays very much like one 
"if this sounds like a wild idea 
"revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies 
vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m .
"sunday morning movie 
stephen kessler's jejune direction doesn't help things either .
he only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish .
"each consecutive "" vacation "" movie has suffered a drop in directing power ."
"we started the series off with harold ramis 
not too bad .
"then we had national lampoon's european vacation being directed by amy heckerling 
"lastly we had national lampoon's christmas vacation 
"kessler 
"granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film

"plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott 
"naturally 
would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ?
"if it was from ridley 
"if it was from tony 
"unfortunately 
"carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen 
"as the tagline clearly wants to make known 
"the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage 
hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead .
plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose .
"although undoubtedly slick and fast paced 
"carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair 
"it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes 
the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story .
"also 
"the story is a bit of a mess 
"the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads 
"her irritable 
"she looks nice 
"more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester 
"ken stott is suitably evil as chance 
i didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived .
"although a disappointment in writing 
"but production design alone can't save a movie 
"jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty 
"the mtv editing and direction are flash enough 
plunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment .
"although somewhat enjoyable during parts 
"there's no thought 
"although it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful 
"sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless 
give it a miss .
"capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story 
gibson's script only adds insult to injury .
johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie .
"i say "" awesomely "" because it's one thing to fail 
"keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny 
"he is given "" one last job "" ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words 
"one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories 
"for his trouble 
"what's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan 
"the yakuza are simply used to point guns 
"( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor 
but that's another essay . )
"anyway 
why newark ?
"maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york 
"there 
the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture .
"it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny's head could save a lot of people 
"handled right 
"the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other 
"everything looks run-down and scummy 
snore .
"the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) 
"a hacker of johnny's caliber would be blasting away with one command-line function after another 
whatever .
what went wrong with this movie ?
"gibson wrote his own screenplay 
"his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn't advance 
"from the script on out 
"renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there's no fun in kicking a wounded dog 
"i didn't hate the big hit 
"for the entirety of its running time 
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl .
"as a narrative 
"it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank 
"it's fine to mix genres 
"unfortunately 
"the biggest problem with the amalgamation 
but it sure is a fascinating failure .

it's very bad to have paris against you .
the story is standard action film stuff .
"it's nothing new 
clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy .
"it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers 
there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story .
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns .

what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness .
"it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy 
"then 
"then 
"keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene 
"and scenes like this work alone 
"one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there 
"the scene is played for laughs 
"and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy 
this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun .
cars land on tree branches and are supported by them .
characters betray each other without a second thought .
grenades are thrown in tight places .
people jump out of tall buildings and survive .
"people outrun tumbling cars 
"most frustrating of all 
"they're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage 
the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch .
"the acting is kind of fun 
"phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character

why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ?

"1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs 
2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ?
i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating .
"3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system 
4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables .
5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ?
"if so 
( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide .
"godzilla would have to be over 1 
"6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters 
"7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters 
8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla .
9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel .
10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ?
maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel .
11 . ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ?
12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ?
"13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day 
14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting .
new yorkers hate beta cam .
"i could go on and on 
"don't be fooled 
the performances in the film are singularly bland .
not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror .
"the characters 
"the only common occurrence that doesn't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement 
godzilla for the most part is okay .
"the design of the beast is funky 
"one thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark 
"now 
a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly .
there is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) .
any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac .

"woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood 
in his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy .
from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles .
some of these work better than others .
zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist .
deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back .
harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives .
he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing .
the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments .
perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out .
"as a writer 
the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life .
"these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion 
it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person .
"if that sounds complicated 
"then as another device in one of the stories 
harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time .
"as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion 
"if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding 
but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand .
"deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry's old college 
harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him .
just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear .
harry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry's old friend larry ( billy crystal ) .
"block would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him 
another friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems .
harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) .
"it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite 
"while the comedy sequences are never complete 
"the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil 
"that story also is left uncompleted 
the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care .
that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes .
allen can do much better than deconstructing harry .
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
"here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject

the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather .

"maybe the film would have been better if 
it certainly would have been more entertaining .
wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment .
"it starts out with noble aspirations 
parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first .
"there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based 
"but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets 
"for from the film's outset 
our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be .
"brasco is joseph pistone 
"regrettably 
"his concern for lefty 
"true 
the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily .
"the biggest problem with donnie brasco 
"the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's 
"more importantly 
"donnie brasco's take on american values 
lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music .
"inexplicably 
"it doesn't any more than his family troubles do 
just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface .
"in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting 
"donnie brasco's tawdry little crime 
"( oh and by the way 
i hear from springfield way ? )
so the movie is cliched .
"big deal 
well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre .
donnie brasco fails on both counts .
the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades .
"admittedly 
"depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself 
the consequences are painful to watch .
its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent .
perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco .
maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks .
"if this is indeed the case 
depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats .
who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ?
"but then again 
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes .
"but 
sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south .
"the way to regain popularity and prestige 
"one of such celebrity was eddie murphy 
"in order to return to the spotlight 
"seven years later 
"this time 
eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback .
"eddie murphy here plays axel foley 
"the routine police action ends in tragedy 
"determined to bring the killers to justice 
"when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles 
"there 
ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different .
"in this decade 
"screenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict 
"since foley belongs to the former 
"unfortunately 
"nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning 
"unlike donner with the lethal weapon series 
"action scenes are sometimes interesting 
"to make even worse 
"in the end 
i have never been so confused after watching a movie .
""" meet joe black "" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year 
at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season .
"at first you marvel at the elegant direction 
"then you'll wait for something to happen for half an hour 
"the script is simply a silly and unresolved story 
it feels like an eternity .
"most of the time it is a pompous soap opera 
"the film is based on alberto caesella's play "" death takes a holiday "" ."
"the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man 
"soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as "" death "" ."
it is bill's time .
but death has other plans .
it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive .
our bill is chosen to be death's guide and in exchange he gets time .
"bill introduces death as joe black 
"bill's business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill's side 
"that is not all 
bill's youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her .
this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences .
"it wouldn't be fair to say that this film didn't have some interesting moments 
"when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love 
it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure .
"it's one thing to say : "" wouldn't it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . """
to create a motion picture out of this is another .
four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic .
it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film .
"on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" ) ."
"hopkins looks great in any role 
"his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else 
but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time .
how can you play death in human form ?
to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters .
"they are not creatures 
saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form .
handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work .
"speaking in a calm

"claire forlani and others are also fine 
unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery .

"chan plays separated-at-births boomer and john ma

but let's face it .
no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway .
the scenes where nothing happens in chan's films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together .
"in the case of twin dragons 
most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers' efforts to hide the other's existence from their own acquaintances .
"why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained 
"the twins' love interests 
"the scenes describing the boys' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot ( in several shots

"a case in point : whenever anyone sees the brothers together 
are we laughing yet ?
"as usual 
never mind that it's not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash-testing facility .

the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film .
it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction .
"that 
"the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head 
"our hero is warrant officer paul brenner 
"his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base 
"complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) 
"general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press 
"teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who 
if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems .
"scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary 
"director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers 
"it's a trend he continues for two hours 
characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans .
west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter .
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits .
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell .
"the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor 
there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another .
"indeed 
even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers .
goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies .
"dialogue 
it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) .
"by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought 
"it's silly and pretentious film-making 
goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine .
cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins .
"while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) 
"the story is confusing 
"the film is based on a "" mostly "" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s 
"it's during the time of the depression 
"between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots 
also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience .
"tim robbin's just keeps piling on political views 
"for robbin's it may be a nice achievement 
"i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast 
"let me recap what each important character does 
i'll begin with those involved with the play .
"there's orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play 
"outside the play there's the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) 
"there's a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon 
"anyway 
"now although most of the film was weak to say the least 
"sure the free speech segment was a nice feature 
"the whole film is like this 
"on the brighter side 
"his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson's latest magnolia 
"although it has it's moments ( not many of them 
"disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life 
"there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach 
"richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel 
"once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach 
"this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element 
the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking .
i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning .
"but that is were many things go wrong 
though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking .
the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts .
"this is where the movie has some great potential 
"now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good 
this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable .
"there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting 
"i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing 
the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child .
although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher .
"the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason 
the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough .
"richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story 
this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused .
"now 
"the cast and acting was passable at the very least 
mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better .
which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ?
( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) .
"but i like the fact that there was an international cast used 
the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable .
not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense .
when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable .
"i would not recommend this movie to anyone 
as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt .
if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings .
kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems .
"it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder 
"she learns that her problems are related 
"her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company 
"a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) 
"kate's boss 
"kate is at first repulsed by the idea 
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan .
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ? .
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up .
she meets nick to propose the plan .
he accepts .
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas .
"the office bad boy 
"now that she is engaged 
"things start to fall apart for kate 
"after some provoking nick does oblige 
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available .
"or maybe kate does like nick 
"adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) 
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra .
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one .
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer .
"it's like the director said 'well 
quite frankly it's insulting .
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie .
"she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role 
her performance was not convincing .
"unfortunately 
"the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions 
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers .
"at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending ."
"no such luck with "" picture perfect "" ."
"every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away 
"after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ?
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision .
"i believe that kate liked him 
i doubt it .
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ?
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ?

i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning .

they ( yawn ) were wrong .
it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth .

"there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore

perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters .
we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling .

the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities .
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge .
"such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein 
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings .
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved .
"it really wasn't until producer george pal 
"from there 
"with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" 
"the film opens on a summer barbecue 
"woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission 
"entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) 
luc consoles jim with woody's assistance .
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them .
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet .
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars .
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface .
"going out to investigate 
a strange noise emanates from the rock .
"as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar 
"back on the space station orbiting earth 
luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team .
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger .
"meteorite showers 
"the big question is 
"and if so 
now for the bad news .
"the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe ."
"the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film 
"borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) 
"while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed 
"so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film 
"the performances are all workmen like 
gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation .
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse .
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better .
he's just having too much fun here to give a damn .
"the script has a few lapses 
this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship .
"also 
"but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid 
subtlety is non-existent here .
in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out .
the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower .
the pacing of the film is very leisurely .
"after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) 
"then 
the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum .
"there are so many scenes of talking heads 
the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at .
the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring .
"the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted 
"the visual effects are just stunning 
"the only fault come with the martians themselves 
director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film .
"the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage' to hitchcock's "" rope "" ) 
"scenes in the rescue ship 
"but the nagging question 
sadly it is not .
director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production .
the set design and visual effects are all arresting .
"but it's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous 
"a disappointing film 
"back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention 
"that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago 
last action hero .
"but no 
if only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe .
you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film .
"at the convention 
to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not .
"after the setup 
they encounter another ship .
they board it .
alien spiders attack them .
they return to their ship .
the other one explodes .
they land on a deserted planet .
and so on .
"an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act 
"the look and effects should be lost in space's ace-in-the-hole 
"for a big-budget film 
"in one composite background shot 
digital effects .
"but nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp 
"entirely computer-generated and every inch showing it 
apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp's composite shots with the human actors ?
"but in doing so 
you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy .
new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount .
i don't think so .
"in a few years 
"the working title for no looking back was long time 
"even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes 
"writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline 
"instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings 
no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful .
"the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide 
"alas 
"and 
peeks of sunshine are few and far between .
no wonder the characters are all so miserable .
"first of all 
"that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) 
"the two have a comfortable relationship 
claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children .
then charlie re-enters the mix .
"so who 
who cares ? ?
no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle .
"so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway 
they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline .
they should know the ending as well as we do .
and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two .
another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters .
"blythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother 
"sadly 
none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes .
edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here .
"jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career 
"the worst case is lauren holly 
"as portrayed here 
"burns' ex 
"when he released the brothers mcmullen 
"two films and three short years later 
some movie makers have only one good film in them .
"with back- to-back duds like she's the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers 
the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it's about and why it's good or bad .
"i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this 
""" get carter "" falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room ."
"you might call them the "" steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers . """
"you know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights 
"they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight 
"sylvester stallone stars as jack carter 
"he believes his brother ? richie was "" taken out "" and didn't die from a dwi accident ."
carter's one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid .
"his face alone is pretty intimidating and there's quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his "" rambo-on-testosterone-therapy "" voice ."
stallone's performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn't realize he's mocking himself .
the actual story involves carter's investigation into his brother richie's death .
he's in a town that's not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well .
"mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters 
"there's also another plot involving richie's mistress 
i'm rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible .
"i could just rip the screenplay to shreds 
i don't like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally .
"yes 
"and what's worse is that it's not this intricate to make it seem smart like "" the usual suspects "" for example - just the opposite ."
you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn't remember what had already happened and didn't figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax .
"all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another 
although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another .
making a movie entirely about criminals doesn't necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters .
"mel gibson starred in "" payback "" a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn't help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter ."
"so ultimately "" get carter "" fails for pretty much every selling point it has ."
carter is not a likable character and you really don't care if he gets revenge or not .
the action sequences are not at all exciting or original .
"the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c'mon 
in the end you don't feel nearly satisfied with the results .
the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible .
* the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it's seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it's always raining .
i've got to admit it . . .
i'm a huge jim carrey fan .
"i loved the first ace ventura 
"until i saw ace ventura 2 
"sadly 
"carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie 
the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) .
"soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and 
"once again 
"those who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability 
"the original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences 
"here 
"instead 
but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself .
"in the first movie 
"but here 
"there are definitely some very funny moments 
"they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura 
"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer 
"sadly 
and not a particularly good one at that .
what went wrong ?
"mi2 begins flashily enough 
"early on 
"in one hypnotic 
"prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain 
why ?
i haven't the foggiest .
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply .
"with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine 
"it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off 
"the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate 
god forbid .
"woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic 
"still in terms of crackerjack eye candy 
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) .
"between the frantic dancing 
"the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way 
"sure it's all smoke and mirrors 
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight .
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres .
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously .
cruise grins a little too slyly .
"the cruise character 
"here cruise plays him more as a hip 
"he's cool and dashing 
"sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial "" i'm the man ! """
charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug .
"mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act 
"the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) 
we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand .
it isn't done any differently here .
the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind .
he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie .
"the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment 
"when he's not beaming away 
he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof .
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers .
"in a classic woo action moment 
"the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise 
the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles .
"though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment 
"not to worry 
what a hero !
you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot .
my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do .
"the film itself has absolutely no concern with story 
i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video .
"nobody will go to this for the plot 
as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing .
"in mi 
"it's irrelevant in every sense 
all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .
"every now and then 
"most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact 
"but 
i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review .
"the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary 
"which surprise me to this day 
"such things happen very rarely to me 
"the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young 
two of them are assigned to cover the train collision .
"as soon as they meet 
the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn .
"movie author 
"however 
"it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix 
"shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two 
"the end result is rather forgettable effort 
"i'll give it the benefit of the doubt 
"the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane 
"if you haven't already figured it out 
the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme .
tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society .
"he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane 
"back in his former home of africa 
( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . )
"anyway 
tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city .
"he leaves jane ( his first mistake 
"of course 
the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys .
sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ?
it's actually an improvement over the real thing .
the acting is just plain awful .
"i'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film 
"jane march wasn't a heck of a lot better 
"compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded 
added to the sound problems was the cinematography .
this film was filled with beautiful african scenery .
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me .
"quite frankly 
then we have the special effects .
""" special effects in a tarzan movie ? """
you are no doubt asking yourself ?
"yes friends 
"probably for the sake of using cgi 
"in most parts 
"but 
"except of course 
the grand finale's special effects went right into the toilet at that point .
it almost looked like they had run out of money .
these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production .
i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don't mix .
stay far away from this version of tarzan .
"silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at "" the last stop cafe and motel "" due to heavy snowfall ."
one of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman ( adam beach ) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery .
"someone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer 
adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film .
he doesn't play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny .
"his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle 
"rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always 
what on earth is he doing in this ?
best performance comes from william s . taylor as a cheesy ( yet still somehow cool and confident ) wayne newton drifter type .
the last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment .
"as usual with sterling 
"the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 
"the film itself might not be the greatest

"so i went and saw this film right 
"well let me be the first to say 
"roger christianson whos credits include set direction

"the sound is terrible 
"the acting is nothing 
"here's the so-called plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endangered species

"one thing : he has to go up against 
"of course the sidekick to terl 
"forest whitaker 
"our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well 
"i'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film 
"everything in this film is imcomprehinsable 
"in fact i don't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time 
in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed .
"throughout the entire 127 minute running time 
"my advice to hollywood : get new scripts 
"by phil curtolo "" madonna - antonio banderas - jonathan price - in an alan parker film - with music from andrew lloyd weber - and lyrics by tim rice - evita . """
"now i have to admit 
the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to .
so why wouldn't the movie be wonderful to see .
"simple 
"the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) 
"she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker 
they fall in love and eventually marry .
"sounds pretty good 
"well the story gets better 
eva duarte was a wonderful lady .
"however 
"i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy 
they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar .
"although it did come off as dull 
"as the "" spiritual leader of argentina 
but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film .
don't get me wrong and don't look at my grade .
i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen .
"if you're going to pay to see a movie 
"now i have to admit 
all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie .
"now you may be saying 
and you're right .
"as a critic 
"but as a 17-year old quentin tarantino fan 
"
i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas .
"with the overt success of the three original star wars films 
"only this toy was made for $115 million 
"the product in question 
no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release .
"i come to the sw franchise as a stranger 
i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy .
"phantom menace is like the first sw 
nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable .
even the special effects seem rather bland .
the story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the
acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game .
sw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far .
"with a title like sw e1 : tpm 
"i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie 
pm is one long headache .
an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices .
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow .
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source .
"the acting in particular i found very good 
"a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot .
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing .
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener .
"all these people acted their parts admirably 
"the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) .
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this .
"the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it .
"all in all i found this movie boring and very slow 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them .
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie .

the film's title is derived from salvaged reel-to-reel audio-recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities .
by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters .
filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn't particularly scary .
the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing .

"the first finds amarillo 
"as olmstead begins his investigation 
lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination .
"all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work 
but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse .
lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .
"he's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau 
"two months earlier 
"lacrosse knows his killer's work 
"it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence 
"there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor 
"we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed 
"a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character 
quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated .
it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .
"even without quaid 
"the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy 
"unfortunately 
"once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched 
"in fact 
"it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead

so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ?

"last of all 
"i mean 
the answer to that question is three letters long .
nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles .
"since arraki doesn't know how to make anything coherent 
let's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls .
the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star .
he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans .
this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming .
"it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki

maybe he just wanted to piss me off .

"jawbreaker is the very definition of a "" rip-off . """
"this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) 
along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own .
"the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels 
liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind .
"liz is about to turn 17 and 
in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her .
"they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later 
"courtney 
things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to .
"in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" 
up until about this point the film is effective enough .
"however 
the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch .
"courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson 
"meanwhile 
julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) .
he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid .
fern's rise to popularity is equally lame .
we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section .
"it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate 
it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense .
stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting .
"william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents 
at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer .
the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .
the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid .
they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color .
"director of photography amy vicent 
shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive .
performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .
"none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali 
"the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like "" auto stud 
"the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen's catchy "" yoo hoo "" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film ."

the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island .

i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film .
i usually enjoy snipes' movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films .

i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 .
"in a word 
"more to the point

"it's a wacky 
at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist .
"screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married 
"from the outset 
it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development .
"by any human standard 
and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness .
"there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers 
"the blandly nice o'donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he tried 
and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation .
"the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny 
"i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing 
"far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly 
"you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor 
nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to .
"the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark

i did not find myself laughing here either .
what we have is a strange crime tale .
- one just does not care what happens to these people .
- the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently .
if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation .
- it begins like diner ( particularly with daniel stern ) and ends up like an extended horror/crime comic book .
- there are several logical holes in script .
"if a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappears 
someone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work .

"but hey 
"and since that was a huge disappointment 
the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it .
unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too .
and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet .

"this is the movie that could single-handedly bring "" mystery science theater 3000 "" out of cancellation ."
"it's one of those movies that's so bad it's absolutely hilarious 
"if you only remember one thing about fair game 
"if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l . a . 
ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition .
"in a real casting coup 
"we all know this is a stretch 
"nonetheless 
"and for you horny teenage boys out there 
"come to think of it 
"cindy crawford isn't black 
"like i said 
billy baldwin ( or is it stephen ?
alec ?
adam ?
"kim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life 
there's absolutely nothing original about this movie .
it's every cop show of the 70's mixed with every action thriller of the 80's and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90's .
"three decades of crap all in one place 
and it's all completely predictable .
"you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them 
the plot isn't really explained until the end .
all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer .
"in the words of one of the villains 
"( yeah 
"he goes on to add 
( _that_ i find very easy to believe . )
"i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes 
"because 
it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn't supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh .
one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief .
"would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like "" i'm very interested in _hard_ware "" and other crap about playing with his joystick ?"
"i wouldn't 
it's just not funny .
crawford's only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords' body . . .
or was it jack lord's body ?
i'll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie .
the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft .
"crawford says woodenly 
i'm filing a lawsuit against you .
"you're in big trouble

"chronicling the meaningless lives of vain 
first-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth .
there isn't one of these characters worth caring about .

"they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone

"the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot 
200 cigarettes runs 1 : 40 .
"it is rated r for profanity 
i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films .
"when done right 
"but it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle 
"tom hanks and meg ryan 
"baldwin's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son 
jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems .
"sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show 
ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it .
annie is a happy woman .
"she is engaged to walter 
"but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show 
"five years after this movie hit theaters 
at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity .
here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five .
the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory .
sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell .
but none of them can save the film from being a bore .
"its characters are dull and empty 
"the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up 
"it's the kind of life decision that real people don't make

it's a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler .

"house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs 
"directed by william malone 
""" house on haunted hill "" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible ."
one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck .
a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water .
"these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks

this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film .
""" house on haunted hill "" 
the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot .
"the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling 
"however 
the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) .
each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money .
"since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring 
the problem is that every character is not likable .
the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) .
"the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic 
"the worst character in this film 
"he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate 
"waiting for pritchett to die 
the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) .
"playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party 
"however

"i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 "" this is a no-no "" dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass

"she'd find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz 
"for children 
to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap .
these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven't earned the right to display suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet ) .
"of course 
i don't care .
"gender be damned 
"braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) 
don't be fooled .
"this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten

"although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher's potential 
it promised to be something unusual .

"because murders can be realistically simulated in movies

in its better moments it's an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom .
"one moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he's reading truman capote's "" in cold blood "" underneath the cover of a porn novel ."
""" in cold blood "" was the father of the true-crime genre 
"max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom 
tom does change-i'll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently .

"of course 
"prince fans might love the soundtrack 
"of the performances 
he was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 .
he should have stuck to acting in this film .
there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up .
"there are scenes shot with different types of film 
"in that film 
"in this film 
"there are some amusing moments 
"other than that 
"there are a few intense moments 
"i'm not the biggest fan of spike lee

"he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman

"well 
it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films .
"we know very little about norris' character while 
"in the end we almost feel sorry for them 
"during the film 
that caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation .
"the photography in this film is dark 
"as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding 
"but 
it's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything .
the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful .
this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor .
"well 
along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber .
thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience .
"the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber 
this is there strictly for the kids .
the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs .
although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone .
"the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at 
admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor ) .
the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable .
"the basketball players 
"this just sounds too bad to be true 
as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie .
"giving life to the flubber 
giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn't for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie .
"the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well 
"now 
it's a robot that prof . brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too .
"this is a really original idea 
yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters .
the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all .
the acting by robin williams ( prof .
brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced .
most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 .
"people when stood up at the altar 
"or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards 
"flubber 
with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great .
"it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end 
kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they'll probably enjoy the whole movie .
as a movie it's just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that .

they're primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra .

"there is the aforementioned ginger spice 
"the spice girls took the world by storm 
it's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves .
"they don't take themselves too seriously 
"it's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * 
"they're not flawless by any means 
"what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won't get enough of their music 
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes .
"most of the film is very blas ? 
"if you're a big fan of the group 
"for the right crowd 
"other key actors include richard e . grant as clifford 
"all provide relatively good performances 
even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it .
"while this film is continuously compared to the beatles' a hard day's night 
"it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits 
"i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film 
"i don't think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun 
and what could've been better than a self-indulged yet self- mocking approach ?

"spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy 
"it's bad 
it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment .

"it's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie

well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you .
because thats all that there really is . . . .
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot .
"for one thing 
i am not saying that this isn't possible . .
but it does leave one to wonder . . . i
know i did .
another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out . . . .
and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations .
there was one scene that should have been short . . .
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking . .
ok enough already get on with it .
there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do . . .
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort . . .
another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning .
this movie is also very predictable . . .
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment . .
granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you .
also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated . . .
it gets boring at times to tell you the truth . . .
even though there is still action going on .
another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero .
some of the characters are not proper for their roles .
the acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up .
"if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot 
the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie .
"the special effects are just amazing 
another thing is the destruction scenes . . .
"wow 
well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie .
this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office . .
unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do . .
i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments . .
go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me .
"one little side note 
and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance . . . .
you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made . . . . .
i thought i'd put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick . . .
its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this .
"when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy 
"toss out your usual objectivity 
"this 
thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) .
directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez .
paulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young .
i got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present .
"for those without such context 
"the acting is amateurish 
"grainy and overexposed 
"confusingly composed 
"quite bloody at times 
why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ?
another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her .
"in retaliation 
this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood .
the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner .
"one 
the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten .
certainly she had to endure a miserable life .
but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good .
i felt trapped in the theater watching it .
only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable .
paulina runs 1 : 28 .
the film is in spanish with english subtitles .
it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers .
"in this year's summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ 
"one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film 
"the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks 
"it's a large family 
"jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family 
"her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek 
"also 
"hala is a spoiled 
"with such an unappealing set of characters 
"naturally 
ho-hum .
"another complication 
that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly .
the jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers .
"the hala-russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived a manner 
"and then there's some atrocious dialogue 
"just looking at them gives me such great sadness . """
"as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is 
they obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share .
"several days after having seen this movie 
this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio .
there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script .
"the premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers 
"edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) 
"along the way 
"the explorers' trek takes them through forests 
"this setup leads to a lot of shouting 
"farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing 
"matthew perry 
"as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy 
"i'm not a big fan of david spade 
"as far as the supporting players go 
"eugene levy is wasted 
"frankly 
"although guest gets the costumes right 
"the special effects 
"for an example of some really poor blue screen work 
"even though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers 
"while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys 
"farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty 
"when i was nine 
"masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy 
"of course 
"given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) 
let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie .
"the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan 
it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars .
"we have the alien bounty hunters 
""" blatant uninspired ripoff "" would appear more appropriate ."
"tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) 
"so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity 
"yes 
one incredible good reason .
his name is frank langella .
"langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood

"and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes 
i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film .
"despite this 
"sadly 
"it's just not possible to make an interesting 
"the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) 
"she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle 
"the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high 
"this formula is repeated several times 
"in general 
no because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me .
"quite frankly 
"the first hour of the film 
we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend .
these early scenes were interesting .
"we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes 
"the movie begins to go downhill 
">from that point 
it all seemed so excessive .
"fine 
couldn't the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ?
or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world .
"quite possibly 
"as i stated at the beginning of this review 
what do they do that warrants a movie ?
strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ?
"i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players 
gia did not .
"and by the end of the film 
"not exactly a meaningful contribution to society 
talk about beating a dead horse !

there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children .
home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire .
"it's one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight 
"adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous 
the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex's schemes are nasty enough to kill .
"but 
"not only is home alone 3 unnecessary 
"it's an exercise in tediousness 
i can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure .
maybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years .

now we're in the nineties .
steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather .
that's about as much of a plot as we have .
there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense .

he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing .
"a group of villains sits around a table 
"at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around 
"the movie is a medley of clutter 
it feels like major portions of the film are missing .

this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing .
there's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher .
"other than that 
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes .
thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn't work .
"she looks good

macnee's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor .
fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town .

the action scenes are difficult to follow .
"director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of "" diabolique "" ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn't be ."

witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination .
"admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film

it doesn't get any better .

there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers .

the following review encompasses two versions of dune :
"dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives 
"the film's visual splendour 
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television .
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline .
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web .
* * * the review * * *
"released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million 
"director david lynch ( blue velvet 
"the screenplay was lynch's own 
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors .
"the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) 
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe .
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it .
"most importantly 
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands .
"one is the long-standing rivalry between two families 
"the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis 
"the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld 
"unfortunately 
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office .
"with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours 
what a great idea !
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ?
"the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative 
"thus their personalities are vague 
the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them .
and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book .
dune is also a very serous film .
"the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment ."
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them .
"humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad 
"you may balk at the comparison 
"the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster 
it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi .
special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight .
both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original .
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years .
"with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography 
see it in the widescreen format if you can .
"and despite all the cuts 
"sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam 
"as paul atreides 
the conclusion ?
any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker .
"david lynch took a brave stab at it and 
dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release .
"many chose to stay away altogether 
"the extended version 
"in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director's cut "" of the film on home video 
"but 
"in a way 
"stung into action 
"he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth "" ."
"certainly 
but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas .
"most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration 
"paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate 
"the political skulduggery involving the emperor 
paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably .
"and as further background 
"as a piece of storytelling 
"as a piece of editing 
"the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough 
"there's some sloppy cutting 
and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg .
"ships coming and going 
"this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected 
it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television .
but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book .
"the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his "" heart plug "" ."
its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work .
"despite its own peculiar flaws 
"all up 
"unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart 
"on repeated viewings 
"still 
"with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 
"in 1970s 
"which wasn't so hard to expect 
"in such times 
"of course 
"for them 
"which 
"one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass 
"salon kitty 
"in 1939 
"none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents 
"the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty 
"screenplay by tinto brass 
"schellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) 
"kitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) 
"caught in the net of depravity is sweet 
"there she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) 
"when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel 
"she informs the madam of the real situation 
"those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film 
"but 
"unfortunately 
"all in all 
"dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor ( 1996 ) 
"he plays doctor john dolittle

"the target audience 
"everyone else 
"the general's daughter is a heartless 
"director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity 
what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm .
"john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess 
"brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) 
"soon 
"ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) 
"perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that 
"on a story level 
"the film 
"having not read the novel 
"scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman 
"( sunderland actually asks brenner 
"to which i would have answered 
"only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle 
"not that it really matters 
"in one scene 
"she sees one of his rings 
"instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect 
"this scene really pushed me over the edge 
"it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene 
"i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters 
this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct .
"compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks 
"these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary 
"in addition 
"this standpoint is certainly allowed 
"as it is 
perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances .
"james woods has a few terrific scenes 
"i also liked james cromwell

"okay 
"there's even a faux-cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned-up to "" splish splash . """
"paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried 
"the end credits note that "" no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture . """
"that very well may be true 
"but "" air bud "" doesn't seem to be interested in anything else ."

what is the point of this ?
"i do not know 
"to attract people to this horrible movie 
"wing commander will draw large crowds 
the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight .
many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game .
"i found this very interesting 
it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though .
freddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair .
wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie .
this was definitely his worst performance to date .
"after january's she's all that 
( for now anyway . )
"christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi 
"blair's parents also fought in the space battles 
"his parents were pilgrims 
"blair is under the command of "" angel "" 
"matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie 
"his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) 
the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth .
"this plot is very flimsy 
"this explains why wing commander drags on 
the acting is horrible in wing commander .
"many lines seem out of place 
"the acting and dialogue was so terrible 
the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music .
the special effects are very unrealistic .
"when looking at two ships flying side by side 
the explosions look very unrealistic as well .
"a ship will be blown up 
this is very unrealistic .
music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time .
"the music also felt like video game music 
"after we are given the plot 
"blair is forced to make jumps over other planets 
"for the entire length of the movie 
"it is truly like you are in a video game 
it's not much fun to watch at all .
"if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships 
"at least star wars pays attention to people 
the bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox !
"bad movies described as "" a swift descent into sinful pleasure 
bad 2000's movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch .
"shadow hours falls into the latter category 
the film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions .
"michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a . one night 
"he drives a porsche 
"the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene 
the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus .
"other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen 
peter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesn't give two shits about it .
"and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs 
"way back in 1984 
shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel .

"for some reason that's never explained in the film 
"in a few unrealistic sequences 
the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous .
why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i
"mean 
it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher .
"and even if he is eliminated 
he's already proven that mercury can be broken .
there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but

"the film flirts with developing real characters 
mr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly .
"miko hughes does a decent job 
"however 
instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! )
willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type .
"rather than creating a nuanced character 
"and for willis' part 
"as almost an afterthought 
but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay .
this film wasn't well thought out at all .
the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible .
the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member .
"at first the bad scenes just trickle in 
the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) .
but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile .
mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer .

well . . . something
about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight .

i know that there's such a good thing as good action - he's called john woo .
"but if you're in the mood for some good old no-brainer 
it's so stupid that it's boring .
vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico .
the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out .
"while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic 
"that is enough action to last us a while and we could 
but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene .
then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that .
the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end .
"and that is something of a pity because the film 
"this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film 
what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires .
there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore .
anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans .
this has not always been carpenter's style .
his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question .
"jack crow heads a vampire swat team 
in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is .
now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) .
"to make matters worse 
meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico .
"if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions 
the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin .
"but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people 
just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown .
"fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding 
"the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized 
"now if all this was not bad enough 
woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well .
but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing .
while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target .
woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero .
that is not his style and it just does not work very well .
there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses .
in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor .
one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair .
as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down .
one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret .
these vampires do not maintain a low profile .
there are arguably logical flaws in the film .
there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires .
"it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires 
i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out .
while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
perhaps i will read the book .

"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas 
there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics .
"spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished 
"but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires 
in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films .
"_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man 
ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers .
the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france .
there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie .
"the equipment 
"the opening sequence 
"another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences 
"the technical side of the film is peerless 
"the camera work is magnificent 
"hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance 
yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events .
"it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film 
throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) .
"for example 
"here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety 
but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact .
"there are no shoes with only feet in them 
"the relentless dehumanization of the war 
"ultimately 
"rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is "" realistic 
"another aspect of the "" hollywoodization "" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular

"rendered in wartime demotic

"conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "" f "" word 
"this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an "" r "" rating due to violence 
"however 
the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg .
he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it .
"as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material

"it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars 
"mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood 
fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles .
this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was .
william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us .
( at least in the movies anyway . )
"it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host 
"charlie and peter won that battle 
apparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling .
so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge .
this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again .
one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood .
fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort .
"while they are stylish 
with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes .
"one bright spot 
it's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film .
"ragsdale does a fair job in this film 
"roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given 
i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way .
"the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner 
never a good thing for a horror film .
another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare .
"for that matter 
"if i was going to watch a horror film 
"the first fright night 
if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes .
either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation .

it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other .

"director mike newell ( "" four weddings and a funeral "" ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark 
the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe .
they'll make you frown in disbelief .
they'll have you constantly looking at your watch .
but wait !

"the film's only saving grace is blanchett 
"this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( "" oscar and lucinda "" ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( "" elizabeth "" ) ."

the camera operation is also the worst i've ever seen in my entire life .
"not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever 
the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow .
"there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" )

uh huh .
there's a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that's artistically good .

"that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun "" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable ."
it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous .
"complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie 
"that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate 
"you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . """
"with "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea 
the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) .
they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization .
they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom .
"along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec 
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can't call the authorities for help .
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back .
the exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right .
"meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses 
mcquarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple .
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie .
"everything has to be complicated and confusing 
"nothing is what it seems in this reality 
"every scene with caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him 
these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet's trash .
"no one here really acts like a real person 
it's like a dream without any appeal .
take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff .
"they sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off 
"the guy and his loud-mouth 
"you'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don't 
"there's a lot of things i didn't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob 
"secondly 
"lastly 
if they were suicidal they wouldn't have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) .
there's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility .
what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is .
absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable .
and it's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time .
"with any film you see 
"i can't say either for "" the way of the gun

"mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school

"this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy

"heart 
"not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is 
"there are frequent sexual references

it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy .

the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning .

"there's a good 
"with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy 
"but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious 
there's not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling .
and everything suffers .
"christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate 
"after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape 
"his young lawyer ( slater ) is fresh out of law school but determined to "" put alcatraz on trial "" for the abuses of it warden ( gary oldman ) ."
the result is the usual courtroom theatrics- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students .
there's very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon's earnest overacting and the appropriate story .
"there's a lot of overacting from everyone--you know you're in trouble right away when r . lee ermey ( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket ) is cast as a judge 
slater has never been convincing and certainly isn't here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances .
but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story .
"there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters 
how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions .
"if there's anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world 
have we forgotten ?
this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 .
"the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil

the same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin .
"i feel the production got a little too smug

either way look out america bean is coming .
"well 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy .
"it achieves that goal rather admirably 
the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed .
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went .
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece .
"but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie 
"the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims 
"now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things

i have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done .
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is .
"i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue 
"now the rest of the actors in the movie 
"i think that the role opposite bean could have been better 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved .
"one thing that i must say 
"tv shows should do just that stay on tv 
"i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved .
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly .
"the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie .
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie .

quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time .

"when i hear people praising this film

over and over .
"this film should not be called the blair witch project 
and argue with each other .
"oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! "" ."
"and if you thought that was scary 
"oh yeah 
"you've never seen terror like this folks 
the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film .
"( for current films 
this film is an example of marketing with no substance .
"the marketing was brilliant 
they want this film to be good .
and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise .
"that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along 
this film could have been so much better .
"just think 
i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it .
she was sold on this film .
"and then 
we supposed to be scared by this ? ' .
"i've heard one opinion that you "" have to use your imagination "" to create the fear in this movie ."
"well 
use their imagination and create a good movie .
i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it .
"but even if you like this idea 
an entity called the blair witch ?
some rednecks fucking with these kids ?
are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ?
i've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something .
"well sure thats scary in real life 
"you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary 
"and no 
actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) .
but you have to do something .
"you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary 
"and by the way 
"aren't these supposed to be "" filmmakers "" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ?"
"i'm not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified 
i'm talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can't seem to shoot anything smoothly at all .
minor quibble there .
there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers .
that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank .
"and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves "" what was i thinking ? ? "" ."
"but 
if it works for them then that's okay i guess .
"i just lament that by making this movie a hit 
pretty soon we're going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell .

and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ?
don't get me wrong though . . .
it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics .

"horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly 
a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video .
it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set .
"the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set 
the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix .
"also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven 
"other extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) 
"some dvd-rom features are also included 
"the commentary track is entertaining and informative 
the first thing of note is that it's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago .
"i'm not saying that's a negative thing 
"everyone seems enthusiastic about being there 
most of the time you'll forget he's even there .
"everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason 
the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series .
also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . .
however you can only access one easily .

"the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling

liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear .
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion .
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia .
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on .
"catherine zeta-jones

"but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones 
"and let's face it 
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it .
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets .
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients .
there really isn't much of a story here .
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with .
and the special effects are great .
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere .
"in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota ."
"at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny 
but not scary .
then we have the set .

"but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did 
this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves .
what part did these rooms play in the story ?
absolutely none .
they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie .
then we have the actors .
lili taylor has never been one of my favorites .
"and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in 
i have no idea why liam neeson took this role .
he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus .
his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him .
i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman .
zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words .
the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake .
all catherine has to do in this movie is look good .
fortunately that is something she does very well .
"while she does have a fairly good size part 
it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here .
any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role .
"the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies 
"the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget

starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way .
now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel .
the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either .
fast forward to the late '80's .
steve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) .
nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role .
that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter .
the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original .
the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets .
it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets .
"the special effects in this movie are cheesy 
"unlike the original

"his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other 
"they voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence "" ."
huh ?
and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get .
"the characters are stupid and shallow 
"the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure 
"we meet the characters as they speak directly to us 
"i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them 
"i'm not trying to be clever or witty 
"with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) 
"i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one 
"in between all the confessionals 
the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me .
this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining .
"if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed 
additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness .
or realism .
one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters .
"they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas 
it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter .
every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner .
body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film .
"it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it 
the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow .
the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred .
the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off .
"this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently 
"unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care 
"paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here 
"it was similarly moralistic 
"the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here 
he gave them heart .
cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones .
"he preaches to us 
this is not the way to get any message across .
why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins ?

"it doesn't even matter that eszterhas tags "" penile implant "" after his own name when he makes a cameo

and there are more problems besides its title .
of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece .
we call it 'modernization' .
"it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics 
this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing .
"kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated 
"and as long as love 
i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing .
"i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak 
he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision .
unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments .
"his latest picture is therefore visually impressive 
"the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) 
jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice .
"their achievement save this film from being completely braindead 
they are nothing more than two celebrities put together .
"the other actors 
delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality .
but there's more than acting to worry about .
"even with li's incredible skills in martial arts 
"to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller 
"it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' 
and in the end it's nothing .
"there are no performances worthy of notice 
"so again 
"this film can boast of great sound 
the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre .
"it is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists 
"but when i think back 
"as in almost every summer movie 
"it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities 
"for someone who has never read shakespeare 
"for those of us who has 
"isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than "" it sucks "" ?"
"one of the first official year 2000 releases 
"i can't seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one 
a shame .
i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate .
but c'est la vie .
here goes nothing .
i'll keep it short .
"i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie 
"the film's fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press 
hill's and mgm's actions were prudent .
"when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident 
"the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and 
"one of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger 
"this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown 
"another one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo 
"evidently 
how ?
why ?
the movie never bothers to explain .
"soon enough though 
"to be honest 
i just remember that i didn't care .
"supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas 
"in fact 
"well 
the performances are hardly worth talking about .
"i'm not even sure i can call what's here "" performances 
"james spader is not a bad actor 
"the action scenes are just as bland 
"and since the action scenes are everything to this movie 
"and for the life of me 
""" idle hands "" is distasteful 
if an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness .
"plus 
the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers .
"the plot 
along the way the hand kills anton's parents and his two best friends .
"the friends 
that is the level of this's atrocity's humor .
the movie treats death as a joke .
""" idle hands "" is gruesome and morbid ."
the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish .
"i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy 
it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life .
"and i can only presume that the writers of "" idle hands 
"however 
"with the real horrors of the world put before us on television 
""" idle hands "" is bad 
but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings .
the time is not right for this type of movie .
"and as far as "" idle hands "" goes 
this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema .
a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings .
"family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years 
"still 
"and after it 
"bye bye love is rarely funny 
only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion .
bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children .
"dave ( matthew modine ) 
"over the course of the weekend 
"the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo 
"randy quaid is the best of the three 
"his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played 
"he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot 
"paul reiser really has only one character 
"as a personality 
"matthew modine 
this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it .
"modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role 
"carolco's executives 
"bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie 
"when the movie does deal with the children at all 
even more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth .
"it is a sad end to flanders' career 
"even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships 
"any way you slice it 
"it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is 
"there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood 
bye bye love is a genuine shame .
"according to the publicity material 
hmm .
"you never know 
"what with the rise of geek chic 
"but then 
"it's cheesy all right 
"that's a shame 
"woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise 
"the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls 
"the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray 
"it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry 
"mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job 
"then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat 
"he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) 
"so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno 
"with the exit of bill murray 
dumb and dumber .
"yes 
"so 
"get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community 
"now 
the trouble is that these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction .
"it lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama 
"some gags fall flat from a lack of build-up 
"why the long 
why two of these ?
"why does that guy wear mascara 
"the film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer 
"well 
the actors don't do the movie much favours either .
"woody harrelson comes off okay

even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie's climax .

starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen .
freeway is giving me second thoughts .
freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood .
"only in the nineties 
to top that pathetic premise off -- reese goes to visit granny and you'll never guess who's waiting under the cover's in granny's bed .
"keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented 
so what are they doing in this movie ?
"after seeing the end result 
you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review .
the answer is quite simple -- i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary .
i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it .
note to keifer : you wonder why you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ?
because you keep making movies like this .
"note to reese : you were great in fear 
"note to both : don't worry about it too much 
bottom line -- i'm still shaking my head .
don't waste your time on this turkey .
"if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie 
"reese witherspoon's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear 
do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .

"this "" movie 
""" how can a movie have guest stars ? """
you may ask .
"well 
blade squad is dumb .
blade squad is loud .
blade squad is obnoxious .
blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series .
why not ?
"after all 
"so 
"to be honest 
"the film has a relatively large cast of characters 
"i'd imagine adolescent males 
i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad .
"i can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11 ."
"and 
"but 
"despite its limited appeal 
"one 
"oh yeah 
"two 
the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end .
"characters' dialogue 
"during one important scene 
"when a character spoke 
"as soon as that character finished speaking 
"this sounds trivial 
"finally 
"foul language is not allowed 
"thus 
"in an early scene of the film 
"when the good guy spouts out a bad word 
"in a "" seinfeld "" episode 
"perhaps future writers 
make up a bunch of new bad words for the future .
"this way 
"compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies 
"when compared to 
"( review written august 12 
what a contrast !
"in the space of two days 
i'm not sure you could get two more different movies .
"while the former was all over the top 
this is one interesting movie .
"it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 
there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men .
hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him .
his big question is : does it all pertain to him ?
"and if it does 
""" it "" means everything : television 
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ?
this is not a movie for answers .
donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions .
that's what makes this movie stay on your mind .
these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time .
"even when we push them to the background 
the performances are all superb in hurlyburly .
"i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact 
"eddie isn't a likeable character 
i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him .
"chazz palminteri is also great as phil 
i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend .
"everyone in this film nails their performances 
it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world .
"unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct 
"i find this fascinating and on two counts 
"first 
"a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world 
"sure 
"second 
where are the stories about women's world ?
"not the soap operas and the "" chick flicks "" that are meant to satisfy women 
hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts .
"it's very talkative 
"while this can make the film drag a bit 
not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas .
not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience .
all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen .
it also means that you have to pay attention .
capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie .
the gags are sporadically funny .
it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes .
the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team .
the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film .
sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching .
this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night .
( and it turns out he had very good reasons . )
"
a film needs a plot .
it needs characters for empathy value .
it needs a story and an emotional center .
if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are .
"kevin smith has now made two satisfying films 
with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp .
peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled .
but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it .
"his remaining two films 
"jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes 
how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call .
"for me 
there was not enough cleverness or variety .
it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay .
penis jokes work only so many times .
showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags .
"they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford 
jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners .
as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts .
in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads .
jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks .
this leaves them at loose ends .
they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie .
they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash .
so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way .
the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood
the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny .
"silent bob 
this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have .
jay has to be the comic .
he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive .
the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny .
he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair .
so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team .
their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before .
"like dogma before it 
certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving .
"they are excuses for gags 
it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content .
the film does not offer much to an adult audience .
i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
the previews for the movie are pretty good .
"they show a little plot 
"unfortunately 
the residents of mystery love hockey .
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football .
"the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes 
"every saturday 
the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated .
mystery's national fame has the town abuzz .
"a week later 
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals .
the mysterians see this as both good and bad .
"on the one hand 
"on the other hand 
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition .
"biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys 
"he's already resentful 
"crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film 
"charlie 
"his "" gift "" of the feature story 
"he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit 
"burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter 
"walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey 
"he wants his son to take the game more seriously 
"reynolds could have been good 
one character actually was interesting .
"biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) 
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community .
she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open .
"her unique insight is verbalized once 
"mysterty 
"the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story 
"instead 
"they try to make you laugh and cry 
"they present the framing and cadence for jokes 
"they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness 
"as columnist molly ivins would say 
the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about .
"there is a funeral scene 
it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important .
"russell crowe steps forward to speak 
"he says that what really matters in life is "" community . . . . """
"then adds "" and hockey . """
i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear .
"only mildly bad 
"i even laughed out loud 
"but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers 
myers is a comic character actor .
"he puts on masks 
"he's great as austin powers 
"nobody else in mysterty 
all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles .
"for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast 
it's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously .
"a suave 
a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche .
a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche .
"a crooked 
"at an intense moment 
complaining about cliches = cliche .
"ok 
so we always hear about cliches .
"but if there was ever to be a prime example 
"not one uttered word 
"they might as well use this as a training film : "" how to make a bank robbery film in the 90's "" ."
karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison .
"she wants to make things right and go straight 
"aware of mccoy's bank robbing expertise 
"he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier 
and if she refuses ?
who knows what he'll do to the kid .
( cue sinister laughter )
this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it's hard to know where to begin .
the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant .
"i can't stress enough how every single element 
basinger is absolutely vacant .
and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ?
"here's someone that spent their time robbing banks 
"as she confronts her son 
"especially when neither basinger nor zach english 
i suppose i should mention val kilmer .
"yeah 
"quite sadly too 
and he got second billing !
"to be fair 
barker .
"unfortunately the script doesn't allow much room for improvement 
we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project .
"the real mccoy just can't keep it's head above water 
"the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer 
"this is definitely one to avoid 
the real mccoy is anything but !
"ironically 
"unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest 
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie .
"not only is it a pathetically bad film overall 
"the plot is scattered 
"it is december 31 
but no one has arrived yet .
her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups .
"some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica 
but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end .
those who are invited are the ones that have the issues .
it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms .
"first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance 
"he is one of the most bland characters 
bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them .
they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections .
"he is nether sexually deprived 
"his lack of flaws is both boring 
as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy .
"moving on 
val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene .
"on the other hand 
"paradoxically 
"of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples 
"wisely 
paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship .
"however 
"finally 
jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before .
"while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self 
"very often 
"however 
"instead 
"first 
"at other times 
there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish .
not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver .
"and yet 
"perhaps 
but it didn't happen that way .
"the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance 
"1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject 
"in summer 1994 
"in few weeks 
"the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland 
"he comes to boston 
"few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past 
"gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror 
"dove 
"while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters 
and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed .
badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all .
"screenplay by john bateer and john rice 
"the plot is 
"the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual 
"those questions 
"because of them 
"the most annoying element of the film 
his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself .
this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive .
"the film have few bright points 
"some of the action scenes are fine 
and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove's colleague .
"but 
"don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive 
"his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving 
"but his joan of arc is a mess 
"jovovich 
"and besson remains a servicable action film director 
"leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english 
"besson's big mistake 
"yes 
"the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as "" the conscience "" ) shows up

"that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels

"detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares 
when rubin was only ten .
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole .
most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison .
to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives .
"lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna

they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings .
"of course 
a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life .
"all too obviously 
that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it .
it's almost cruel .
"the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey 
witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists .
the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie .
it's formula stripped to the bare necessities .
you have your wrongly accused black man .
you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene .
but there's nothing else .
you'd expect some sort of involving investigation .
but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence .
thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding .
brooding to himself .
brooding to other inmates .
brooding to lesra .
brooding to lesra's canadian friends .
brooding in letters .
i don't think i'll ever look at brooding the same way again .

the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously .
"we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia 
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him .
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him .
"no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact 
"i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally 
"the movie cuts again 
"the young man 
"we meet tristen and steven 
"steven is a skeptic 
"tristen 
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly .
"( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant 
how did i know ?
"because in bad movies 
"the fourth member of their party is erica 
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery .
"kim is dressed completely in black 
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained .
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised .
"they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp 
"there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well 
"the movie veers off at this point to spend many long 
"sexual innuendoes are tossed around 
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary .
"the next day 
"the videotapes are missing 
ooh .
spooky .
the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes .
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night .
wacky hijinks ensue .
"tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch 
"throughout the entire ordeal 
"when they do this 
( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes .
"okay 
nevermind . )
this movie was awful .
simply awful .
the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development .
erica is the nature-loving wiccan .
tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman .
steven is the overbearing asshole .
kim is the antisocial goth girl .
"old 
how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ?
because she's pregnant !
how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ?
because she wears a lot of eye makeup !
how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ?
"because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of "" deliverance "" !"
this is weak storytelling at its worst .
"rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic 
it didn't work .
"on top of being poorly developed 
"( "" honey 
"let's get on a plane home . """
""" no ."
"i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on . """
""" ok . "" )"
"frankly 
i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film .
the first movie worked by never showing us the horror .
"the witch was a palpable presence in that movie 
"the horror was all off-screen 
this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie .
blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out .
"this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat 
"knives plunge into flesh 
"this movie didn't stop with showing us the gore 
"by the end of the movie 
"it is all explained ; in fact 
"i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster 
"i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no "" monster 
"i found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director's intent 
( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so .
"and if there was no witch

hm ? )
blair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie .

"i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing 
maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny .
"in mine 
or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking .
because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one .
at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing .
brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it .
wrong mel !
"i would call you a boob mel 
this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad .
he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out .
"but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired 
the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr .
( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . )
lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave .
"hold on 
it's just too funny .
racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ?
"oh wait 
i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head .
but i digress .
"anyway 
"golly 
"he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) 
"together 
not one person in this movie gives a decent performance .
"wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie 
"ok 
the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day .
i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience .
i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions .
"actually 
i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .
mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film .
2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off .
it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways .
"i'm not going into much greater detail than that 
"while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction 
"this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello 
"while the story isn't much 
"james spader's character 
and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron ( in her first role ) .
you know a movie isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women .
even if they are both gorgeous .
i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted .
but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result .
"while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting 
"if i were to put a number on it 
"this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent 
not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again .

"but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay 
so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ?
not a hell of a lot .
"as i have mentioned 
he acts like the rapper that he is .
"the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced 
"as for his script -- well 
"if you haven't yet figured it out 
co-star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story .
"the fact of the matter is that griffin 
"he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour 
"he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) 
"and indeed 
foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters .
"every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers 
believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard-earned $8 .
you'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don't have cable .

"i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months 
"the fact is 
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people .

"i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release 
"on the contrary

"when i first saw screenshots from the film 
"and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving 
"but then there was the hype 
"in the last weeks before the picture opened 
i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell .
i just wanted to see the movie .
"reader 
i did not have an anti-hype reaction .
the hype was unavoidable .
i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released .
"five minutes into the phantom menace 
""" who are these jedi knights ? """
i asked .
""" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? """
""" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? """
""" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? """
these were just some of my questions early on .
"later

"by the end of the film 
"george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless 
the phantom menace is no star wars film .

it's an embarrassment .
"i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored

this is not what i wanted to see .
"i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth

"the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious 
there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form .
"the way lucas has handled it 
"first of all 
not one thing .
what was his life like before this film ?
"well 
that's why he feels like a plot device .
"this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role 
"obi-wan 
"mcgregor has just a few lines 
"since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace 
"things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film 
i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting .
"and when anakin says goodbye to his mother 
"also fairly good is portman 
"jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i've ever had to endure 
"as soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over 
"i've seen many movies that qualify as "" special effects extravaganzas 
the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint .
"i can't say that i didn't find the effects original 
but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome .
"my breaking point was near the end of the picture 
can't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ?
i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours .
and then there's the question of magic .
what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ?
i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel .
"john williams' familiar score is no help 
i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here .
"i longed for the magnetic presence of han 
and what about the ridiculous expectations ?
"mine weren't that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving 
"instead 
"i don't hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exists 
it's here to stay .
"i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them 
the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic .

"to fill his time 
jack is in even worse shape than harry .
he's dying of cancer with only a year to live .
things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him .
"instead of the routine errand that ross expects 
this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before .
"through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies 
"it's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale 
the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario .
"by the time they show you 
"the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross's relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) 
"these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief 
rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it's not explained or i didn't care enough at that point to remember .
a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform .
"it's also not funny

"newman is a grand actor 
he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out .

"the actors do what they can with lame dialog 
"james garner who plays ross's old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat 
"the best part of the film is the look at old friends 
the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen
the film doesn't run very long before the audience realizes that it's hopeless .

this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it .
"this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle 
"in this one 
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land .
"around the 20-30 minute point 
does he ?
"seagal is rescued by some inuits 
"one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan 
of course .
"at one point 
"he even goes as far as to say 
i have no problem with violence .
"i'm a huge john woo fan 
"in the films of seagal 
"at some points 
"this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all 
"but seagal is serious about his skill 
i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence .
"but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle 
"the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish 
"then at the end 
"what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant 
"as far as seagal and his acting 
"he squints 
period .
nothing else .
"oh 
"of course 
"michael caine 
"he does it well 
"of coure 
"his big henchman 
"and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid 
"and also 
"anyway 
"they all have this same formula 
"i mean 
"but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad

"arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar 
review ======
"well 
"however 
this of course doesn't mean its bad .
"some of it is amusing 
arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love .
"kevin pollack is the stereotypical female-fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes 
couteney cox is the stereotypical career-minded woman who falls in love .
julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman .
( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical .
"this film uses a lot of formula 
so what is good about the movie ?
well as i said there are a few amusing moments .
"surprisingly 
also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual .
"gee 
not much to say about the film really .
it is just kind of there .
"watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time 
_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it .
"i could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s 
"if there is a movie theater in hell 
"the story 
"after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him 
"who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed 
"after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks 
"there's a new wrinkle 
"todd and his brethren are declared obsolete 
"after losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee 
"if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet 
the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute .
it's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples .
"unlike that mind-twisting classic 
"add into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction 
and the special effects !
remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ?
gary busey is in this movie .
'nuff said .
_soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults .
that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all .
"now if you'll excuse me 
it's a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it .
such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ .
"though the blurb alludes to "" a jungle filled with political intrigue 
"he hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) 
"they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch-doctor aspirations to conceal a pre-arranged arms deal 
"congo escapes 
the end .
_the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable .
it is merely _there_ .
"the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated 
"the film is shot through with all the tired old "" inscrutable japanese samurai "" and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie ."
"it is quite slow-paced 
"most of the acting is fair 
"lance henriksen is his usual scene-chewing self 
the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery .
"i paid $3 for this film 
"if you are in the mood for samurai 
skip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die-hard henriksen fan .
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives .
are we doing what we want to be doing ?
what happened to our dreams ?
"with the new millennium 
the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren't doing it for many anymore and they're looking for something else .
we'll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years .
ricky hayman ( jeff goldblum ) is having a career crisis .
"the programming director for the good buy home shopping network 
new producer kate newell ( kelly preston ) is supposed to whip things into shape .
"when the two are fixing a flat 
g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don't really want all that commercial crap .
"in some unexplained manner 
ricky is saved .
the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all .
it's not an over-the-top comedy or a heart-warming message of humanity .
it _is_ a mish-mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog .
"i am willing to put up with preaching from a film 
you should take time to smell the roses .
selling your soul for cash is a bad idea .
golly .
i'm glad i saw the movie .
i never would have thought of these .
the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed .
"when g takes a chainsaw to the set 
it doesn't happen .
the bits are so subdued and overly-long that there's only a hint of laughter from the audience .
murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better .
there are hints of promise in this one .
the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved-headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen .
the others are horrendous .
"goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career 
his relationship with kate makes no sense .
they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen .
preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be .
somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value .
"an attempt to satirize stupid television 
"m : i-2 
"it tries to be a spy/romance movie 
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human .
"the coolest thing about this movie 
the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence .
"except for the choreographed action sequences 
"as for the action scenes 
"m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes 
"the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus 
"the only thing that kept me awake 
it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series .
"but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it 
"john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases 
"the star of the film and co-producer 
"cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile 
"their romance didn't work 
"the film opens with dizzying speed 
"we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney 
"first 
he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain .
which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as
we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil .
"the one who played the villain 
"at least 
"soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri 
"before they crash the plane and parachute out of it 
"he steals the package with the antidote 
sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices .
"we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible 
"woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground 
"it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character 
"next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest 
"hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help 
"he is told 
hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds .
"actually 
"in seville 
"he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal 
"the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him

"ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah 
"ethan does this rescue against all odds 
"ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle 
if i was only entertained by this . . . i
could have lived with it .
"but this film was so badly made 
"in any case 
ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad .
the review
"jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return 
no film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better .
"while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) 
"this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world 
he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away .
universal soldier : the return is truly poor .
"the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade 
"soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors 
"considering the poor box office performance of soldier 
"luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) 
"in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series 
"working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley 
"unfortunately 
"the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive 
"there are lots of fights 
there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch .
"luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on 
"erin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her 
whatever .
"other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers 
not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it .
"when fuelled by don davis' loud 
"director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace 
"his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows 
"if only jean-claude weren't getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li 
"to place the blame squarely at van damme's feet 
"i'm not sure that anyone 
one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access .
"he cringes 
"they all do 
"eh he he he "" the script's and indeed the entire film's only saving grace is goldberg ."
"he chews up every scene he is in 
"he even gives the film a few laughs 
"sadly 
the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .
"that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized 
such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment .
"one need merely look back to last summer 
"the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized 
"you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more 
those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house .
"others will simply stare 
"lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner 
"dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison 
"sherry 
"indeed 
that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows .
big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs .
"doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film 
"unfortunately 
"suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid 
"of course 
"and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast 
"unfortunately 
"martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times 
he's just big momma without the makeup on .
"i won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed 
"there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure 
"i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film 
"the gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big 
its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant .
big momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny .
it's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .
"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right 
"not that cindy does that bad 
"and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty 
sure .
william baldwin isn't a bad actor .
"unfortunately 
"i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey 
"if it was the latter 
cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie .
which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement .
"although to be fair to cindy 
"so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford 
"well 
cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents .
"why woud they target someone as likable as cindy 
by the end of the movie you won't care .
the story is so contrived it isn't funny .
"anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house 
"who's character 
"the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea 
the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes .
"if i was baldwin 
"as for crawford 
"unfortunately 
"this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind 
"it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot 
unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you .
take a look at the following equation . . . .
a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged
"yes 
"scrooged is alternatively sick 
"bill murray plays frank cross 
"he's evil to secretary 
"however 
"frank cross isn't 'funny' mean 
"he also isn't very good at emotional scenes 
"however 
"sadly 
"whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny 
"and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 
"who 
the script is horrendous .
"michael o'donaghue churns out terrible 
"and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes 
"the special effects look nice 
there's some impressive make up effects also .
"the music is also good 
but great effects and make up don't make a great film .
"scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience 
"why didn't cross just look out his exec window 
"overall 
"synopsis : a maniac 
"even with a handgun 
comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge .
"not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) 
"this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans 
"henstridge 
"( the cast also includes christopher lambert 
how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me .
adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) .
boston has changed dramatically in those ten years .
"it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with "" policia "" printed on their doors ."
"some guy has a really bad virus 
"so 
that's it .
76 minutes never seemed so long .
this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie .
the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character .
the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight .
a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston .
"in her opening monologue 
"twenty minutes into the film 
"in a defining scene of the movie 
this fake passport drops to the ground .
lambert's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away .
must not have been a good fake .
this emphasizes another fault with the film .
things just defy common sense .
"lambert's cop 
adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for .
"i found myself rather bored with this film 
don't fear the rush .
fear the movie .

"post-chasing amy 
"( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it 
if only kevin smith could write them all . . .
"schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max 
"they are soon engaged 
"he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book 
"the trouble is 
"to stretch this flat 
"hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film ; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue ; and lee 
"so hysterically funny in chasing amy 
"the script's idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a "" sensitive man "" 
"as for avital 
"she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer 
"there are a handful 
"i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club 
over and over until he's booted off stage .
there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's on the page .
"kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke-machine friends that spawned schwimmer's movie career 
"yet another brainless teen flick 
stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored .
their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there .
one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie .
everything about it annoyed the hell out of me .
"the acting 
the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film .
"the "" big "" stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality ."
i felt like i was watching dawson's creek episode 200 .
although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast .
"the "" surprise "" ending was sooo predictable ."
since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ?
go is dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's all that = go home and watch something else .
"set in harlem during the great depression 
""" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings ."
"the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) 
"by turning against the queen 
"the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance 
"he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) 
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch .
bloody gang warfare ensues .
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign .
his new army questions his methods .
his girlfriend ( vanessa l . williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions .
"most importantly ( in his eyes ) 
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it .
this movie is not original at all .
"in fact 
"if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit 
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ?
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 ) .
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader .
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop .
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him .
"high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader ."
blood relative of the leader murdered .
"war erupting between the "" families "" ."
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members .
new leader runs family differently from previous leader .
large meeting with all families involved .
the setup in this movie is done rather well .
"i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery ."
"this was the way of life in harlem 
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work .
"i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry 
"after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing 
"it was a huge distraction 
who was the screenwriter kidding here ?
some of the individual performances were well done .

"its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell 
he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents .
"given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys 
"eleven years later 
"along the way 
"talon vows to help 
"fortunately he frees himself 
"then 
"unfortunately 
"what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping 
"never once does the story seem to connect together 
this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia .
"after telling him that he needs his help 
"wait a minute 
"if that is the case 
and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ?
"these questions are just never - no 
"another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life 
"in addition to the extremely bloody scenes 
"even some attempts to make it exciting 
it just completely fails altogether miserably .
"the only good thing about this film is its musical score 
"the score is boomy and adventurous 
my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) .
"ironically 
"to my relief ( and delight ) 
"critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer 
"leonard maltin rightfully called it "" second rate in scripting 
"i totally agree with these reviews 
will be forgotten about .
there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer .
"i hope you get a good laugh out of this review 
"in fact 
this movie stinks !
"although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances 
"i knew i was in for trouble when 
"this might seem like a minor detail 
and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training .
"or what about when brenner tells a suspect that 
how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ?
"now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up 
"for example 
the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing .
"but instead of arresting him 
duh !
"ultimately 
"when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter 
"no 
"eventually 
i won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime .
i will just mention one final flaw .
brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia .
"the rape occurred in west point 
he is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case .

"unfortunately 
"with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects 
"the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers 
"like some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) 
their method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks .
"to commemorate their victory 
"their celebration is short-lived 
"woods' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives

"the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) 
"along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) 
upham in _saving private ryan_ .
"some stuff happens in the middle of the movie 
"_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix 
only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick .
but it's too little too late .
"we get the inevitable final confrontation 
"interestingly 
woods' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride .
and his motive for killing vampires ?
take a wild guess .
( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . )
at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness .
_vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot .
"to make up for this 
it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie .

"sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role 
barrymore doesn't seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it : beauty but no attitude .

bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show .

that's just the first thirty minutes !
this film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself .
it's confusing to anyone who doesn't know the series ( i include myself in that group ) and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series ( i include die-hard highlander fan the arrow in that group ) .

nuff said .
`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan .
"to pull something like this off 
"something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements 
"with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player 
"judging by the ridiculous premise 
"the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' 
"done right 
"unfortunately 
the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be .
i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward .
those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats .
"these bats are not very nice 
"boy 
they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart .
they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all .
"a whole bunch of people in texas get killed 
"they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with 
the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good .
"but no 
"the film 
"on the small screen 
"but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure 
"even the bats themselves are cheesy 
"the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) 
"the scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) 
"meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable 
her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' .
"everything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel 
"the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw 
"in fact 
"take one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) 
"unfortunately 
"in the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe 
"mccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects 
"the entire town of gallup 
something like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ?
i just want my money . '
"the bats are ugly 
"there's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing 
"only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been 
characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire .
let's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ?
"you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one 
this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats' .
"the most interesting part of "" can't hardly wait "" just happens to be not only the most human 
"that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) 
"the film wisely holds over this moment 
too nicely .
"for some members of the audience ( read : me ) 
we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place .
i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this .
"after all 
"everyone's here : the jock 
"except for denise 
"unfortunately 
"the film 
"however 
"we follow several of them 
"and if we did 
"here's a quick low-down : it's graduation 
the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party .
""" can't hardly wait "" just opts for a big indoor keg party 
"we follow many people around 
"now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend 
though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) .
"since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film 
ugh .
"the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not "" american grafitti "" or "" dazed and confused 
"the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters 
"this film forgets to satirize its characters 
then says that it's all okay .
"we can't take this film seriously 
"but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction 
"generally 
"i actually did like seth green 
"and 
"however 
"she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film 
she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters .
"she may ruin the film more 
"a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character 
"basically the worst thing about this film 
"we don't feel for these characters because for most of us 
the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it's portraying ?
the answer for this film is no .
"nice try 
"the film may be called mercury rising 
"the "" hook "" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic ."
"however 
those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed .
mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism .
the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow .
"i don't know whether the problem is in the original book 
"once again 
"while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood 
"the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold 
"unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time 
the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player .
"soon 
"along the way 
why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ?
"apparently 
"to make sure it can't be cracked 
"of course 
"when he calls the phone number listed in the solution 
"as a result 
"but he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold 
"it's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do anything exceptionally well 
"for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like 
the climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness .
"overall 
bruce willis' star seems to be fading .
"this is his fourth straight lackluster outing 
"willis isn't terrible 
"alec baldwin 
"the film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare )

"a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie 
"the script isn't just "" dumbed down 
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone .
"presumably 
that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible .
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors .
stargate was a financial success .
independence day was a runaway hit .
"and 
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid .
"godzilla isn't completely without merit 
"there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan 
"frankly 
"there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens 
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level .
"godzilla never really pushes the envelope 
"the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass 
( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? )
"worst of all 
"with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end

recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep .
he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour .
then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food .
then he took down a volume of shakespeare's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot .
"and then 
the result ?
william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure .
"though 
the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds .
this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can't see what is going on .
and filming the dialogue in voice over .
and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model .
and making the frame go still while flashing the character's name at the bottom .
and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion .
"i mean

and dicaprio's awful performance doesn't help .
luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us .

her marriage is cold and unfulfilling .

douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films .
mortensen showed promise in the past .
here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces .
the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman .
he's only on-screen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears .
the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense .
surprises are important .
in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen .
and nothing ever does .
nearly every event is telegraphed in advance .
close-up on this object or that action and it's easy to guess what's going to happen .
as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile .
it's a hopeless quest .
the story doesn't make much sense .
steven's wife is loaded .
"even with unfriendly relations 
when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice .
"if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife 
"no matter how sleazy he is 
why would steven plan the murder as a break-in in their apartment ?
why not just take her out as she was walking to david's loft in a bad neighborhood ?

he is the president of the united states of america .
where does the film go wrong ?
it cannot be the acting .
"clint eastwood 
"the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences 
even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre .
"the fault clearly lies in the screenplay 
"while setting up a story about misuse of power 
not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax .
"rather 
"an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood 
"police officers are everywhere 
"at the same time 
all three parties are unaware of each others presence .
"this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood 
"he will probably have a brilliant plan 
"however 
the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes .
ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap .
the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . .
parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter .
"the daughter blames her father for never being there for her 
of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family .

"this time 
there's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason .

"anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i 
"though good-looking 
so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting .
this is jodie foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice to show off her acting chops .
"she's trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens 
"the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive 
"the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( "" father 
"why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) 
"meanwhile 
"the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain's doing which arouses suspicion in siam

"he 
there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king's younger daughters dies .
"it's your classic deathbed scene 
anna then comes in and cries a bit .
the sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer .
"i'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time 
this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren .
we never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care .
"this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant 
"i do not doubt tennant's ability to put together a decent movie 
"the sets and scenery are gorgeous 
even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia .
we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe .
"i liked both foster and yun-fat 
"foster's generally stoic persona serves her well here 
"yun-fat is especially effective 
what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations .
"the cast is great 
this is an emotionless costume epic .
robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein .
"mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life 
"unfortunately 
"it is 
"the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year 
"this is not surprising in and of itself 
"mel brooks does not take advantage of this 
the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice .
"cary elwes 
"he escapes and 
"he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil "" sheriff of rottingham "" ."
a good adventure plot that is sadly unused .
"elwes and lewis are both excellent comics 
"neither actor has any good words to work with 
perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone .
"this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted 
"much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout 
"chuckles were few and far between 
"scenes that could have been classics 
perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive .
"the basic plot 
"mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish 
the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails .
"the addition of a blind man who stumbles around 
the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard .
"he is well worth waiting for 
"if you can't 
"with his successful books and movies 
"with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) 
"however 
"this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull 
"considering the huge budget 
"the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) 
"however 
"along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) 
"they investigate the spaceship

"the film starts off entertaining enough 
"the film jaunts along from scene to scene

"hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie 
"stone is useless 
"the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson 
"but he's hardly in it 
"the same goes for peter coyote 
"the director 
"the drama scenes are 
"the writing doesn't help much 
"although crichton is great with plots 
"the speech is too simple 
practically every line is just stating the obvious .
none of it is smart .
"also 
"the sphere itself is impressive 
"there's a giant squid attack in the picture 
"i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid 
"but the whole scene is done badly 
"finally 
levison can't handle his own plot .
"it leaps from hokey sci-fi 
"and 
it's not all that bad though .
"the plot is all right

not really worth seeing .

i guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid .
"i'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of 
nothing about this movie works .
it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly .
most of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny .
it's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world .
i'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny .
"in reality 
"there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the "" hot babe "" of the movie walking by in her bikini ."
olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl .
everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned .

"nothing more 
"dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife 
libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough .
"ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this 
winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles .
people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right .
though i don't think he will win another oscar again .
the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons .
"even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer 
"burglary 
the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime .
hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent .
that would just be plain stupid .
"while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap

"easy--look for a loophole 
"so instead of studying 
director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot .

my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end .
anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually .
that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep .
he was the most likable character in the movie .
who wouldn't enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ?
"anaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube's character and the british guy 
"however 
the writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines .
i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny .
"did she retort with a clever 
of course not !
""" i'm trying to work ! """
"gee 
she could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . .
"; p but i will admit 
"as for the plot 
"this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous 
( harrier snake ? )
not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims .
the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy's g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him .
that was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible .
"( if someone could explain that movie to me 
all the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! )
"i wasn't inspired by the acting 
"i can't blame the actors 
it's not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with .

synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion .
"reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style 
comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies .
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner .
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title .
"not even her starring role in this turkey 
"it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries 
"the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed 
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel .
"to this day 
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother .
"i have never read this book 
"if not 
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene .
"a young ayla 
tramps about in the woods .
"with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her 
"what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er 
leggings ) .
"tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well 
as the earthquake slowly recedes .
"a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch 
i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point .
this movie is really stupid .
it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief .
"also 
the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four .
"a blond 
"she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories . """
yep .
we get it .
we get it .
"the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up 
"the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously 
"as stated before 
the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt .
the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .
this movie also suffers from its new age trappings .
"maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 
"add to this the film's faux-mysticism 
"the clan of the cave bear is rated r 
it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity .
the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes .
the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear .
the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about .
"although this may sound gratuitous 
the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie .
"however 
"typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man 
"the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that

? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don't realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ?

"indeed 
"i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion 
"his camera trickery is interesting for a little while 
"what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is )

"i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . """
"maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse 
"if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery 
"just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story 
arrrrrrrghhhh .
.
.
"then again 
"though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help 
where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ?
"case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with 
"the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute 
"the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help 
"according to frankie page 
go clubbing !
"sure 
"arquette 
"scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat 
"even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes 
"even more curiously 
father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic .
"as for pryce 
"trust me

"first of all 
"how come an atheist like her was chosen 
"actually 
"supposedly 
which one is it ?

"if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas 
"there's nothing the catholics need to worry about 
""" stigmata's "" religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church ."
"if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters 
"i'm not catholic ; in fact 
"it's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as "" stigmata "" does ."
"it' s not thought-provoking 
"i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film 
maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever .
"the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over 
"like so many films of the mtv generation 
"so much is overdone in "" stigmata 
i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering .

"the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog 
"john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own ."
not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time .
"of course 
"boorman 
"boorman obviously had a sizable budget 
"this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) 
"his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination 
"if boorman is anything 
"unfortunately 
""" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies 
"his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz 
"but 
"the events take place in the distant year 2293 
"in fact 
it's more middle ages than space age .
"the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands 
"these immortals never grow old 
"however 
"if someone breaks the rules enough 
"one of the immortals 
"like "" the wizard of oz

"from inside his giant

that line alone is worth the movie's cult following .
"one day 
"once there 
"they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection 
"i say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is ."
"it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces 
"just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper 
"boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance 
"he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera 
"sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 
"he got exactly that in "" zardoz 
i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements .
is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ?
is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ?
"or is it a social statement 
karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary .

"maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies

"the kids go through the motions
